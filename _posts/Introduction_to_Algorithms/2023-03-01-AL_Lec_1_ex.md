# Merge Sort implemented in C++

I code a [C++ function](https://github.com/Wu-Haonan/Introduction_to_Algorithms-CLRS/blob/main/clrsCpp/lecture_1/Merge_Sort.cpp) to implement Merge Sort Alg, which, I know, is not the best way to do it but able to represent the whole idea of it. In fact, I met some troubles in the beginning, and I am confused to it. So I checked the memory and recorded the values and addresses of critical variables. So I draw the following figure to help us understand the Merge Sort Alg in detail and how C++ works when implementing it.

I thought the most important point is that we transfer the address of array to the 'Merge' function. Reviewing the whole process, when we creat Left_array and Right_array, computer wil assign new memory for them each time . And when they are merged through 'Merge' function (called 'Merge_operation' in Merge_Sort.cpp), actually, we input the address of original array (relative to current Left and Right array) to the function. That means, we permutate the number in original address (of original array). And 'Merge_operation' funtion will return the address of original array (and now it has sorted). This process guarantee the all arrays (or sub-arrays) in each level is sorted in original address (same as they were created).

# Binary Search algorithm

The pseudocode for iterative <i><b>binary search</b></i> is shown in the following.

{% highlight pseudocode linenos %}
Iterative_Binary_search (A,v,n) 
// A[1...n] is the sorted array
// v is the query number
// n is the length of the array
    l = 1
    r = n
    while l != r
        m = [(l+r)/2]
        if A[m] < v:
            l = m
        else:
            r = m
    if A[l] = v:
        return l
    else:
        return NIL
{% endhighlight %}

The recursive version is shown below in psudocode

{% highlight pseudocode linenos %}
Recursive_Binary_search (A,v,l,r) 
// A[1...n] is the sorted array
// v is the query number
// l,r are left and right bounds, 
// equal 1 and n in initialization
    if l = r:
        if A[l] = v:
            return l
        else:
            return NIL
    else:
        m = [(l+r)/2]
        if A[m] < v:
            Recursive_Binary_search (A,v,m,r) 
        else:
            Recursive_Binary_search (A,v,l,m)
{% endhighlight %}

Note: here [x] means ${\lceil x \rceil}$.

For each version of binaory search, we halve the range of searching each time, so the recurrence is 

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
T(n) = 
\begin{cases}
\Theta(1) & \text{if } n =1,\\
T(n/2) + \Theta(1) & \text{if } n >1.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

we can draw a recurrence tree (shown in below) to get the solution

</p>

Therefore, ${T(n)=\lg n \times \Theta(1) + \Theta(1)=\Theta(\lg n)}$
