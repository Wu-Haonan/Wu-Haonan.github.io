From today, I will post my study notes of Introduction to Algorithms (following SMA 5503). In the meantime, I am going to finish the assignments in this book and post my solutions coded in both python and C++ (share in my github repository). Besides, I also want to become familiar with C++ during this process.

The web page and videos are available on [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/video_galleries/video-lectures/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/video_galleries/video-lectures/)

The assignments are available on [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/pages/assignments/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/pages/assignments/). And the solutions is available on  [https://walkccc.me/CLRS/](https://walkccc.me/CLRS/).

Just in case, I didn't figure out how to solve some problems, I will refer to other solutions. C++ versions are at [https://github.com/walkccc/CLRS-cpp](https://github.com/walkccc/CLRS-cpp) and [https://github.com/Yangjiaxi/ItA](https://github.com/Yangjiaxi/ItA).

# Analysis of Algorithms

The theoretical study of computer-program performance and resources usage. 

Let's start out with a simple problem, <i><b>sorting problem</b></i>.

Input: A sequence of ${n}$ numbers ${<a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n>}$
Output: A permutation (reordering) ${<a'_1,a'_2,\cdots,a'_n>}$, <b>such that</b> ${a'_1 \leq a'_2 \leq \cdots \leq a'_n}$

## Insertion Sort

{% highlight pseudocode linenos %}
Insertion-sort(A) // sorts A[1...n]
    for j <- 2 to n
        key <- A[j]
        i <- j-1
        while i>0 and A[i] > key
            A[i+1] <- A[i]
            i <- i - 1  
        A[i+1] <- key
{% endhighlight %}


For each time the part of array before the ${j^{th}}$ element (${key}$) is sorted. And the goal for each loop is to increase the length of (add one) the sorted part. And the way we do that is that we copy the ${key}$ to move forward to find an appropriate place for ${key}$ and we insert it in that place.

Now, we will analysis the Insertion Problem. First is about Running time.

## Running time

Runing time depends on a lot of thing.

1. Depends on input situation (eg. the array is already sorted or is a reverse sorted array)

2. Depends on input size (eg. 6 elements vs 6000 elements)

    perameterize in input size (treat the time as a function of the input size)

3. Want know the upper bonds of the running time.

## Kinds of analysis

Worst-case analysis

${T(n)}$ is defined as the maximum time on any input of size n.

Average-case analysis

${T(n)}$ is defined as the expected time over all input of size n. (need assumption of statistical distribution, like uniform distribution).

Best-case analysis (bogus)

## Worst-Time of Insertion sort

BIG IDEA!! is asymptotic analysis

1. Ignore machine-dependent constants

2. Look the growth of the running time ${T(n), n \rightarrow \infty }$
   
<b>Asymptotic notation</b>

${\Theta}$ notation: Drop the low-order terms and ignore leading constants.

Ex. ${3n^3 + 90n^2 -5n + 60 = \Theta(n^3)}$

As ${n\rightarrow \infty}$, ${\Theta(n^2)}$ alg always beats a ${\Theta(n^3)}$ alg.

Come back to Insertion sort analysis

Worst-case: input is reverse sorted

${T(n)=\sum_{j=2}^{n} \Theta(j)=\Theta(n^2)}$

the above formula is a arithmetric series

## Merge sort

{% highlight pseudocode linenos %}
Merge-sort(A) // sorts A[1...n]
1. If n=1, done // constants time
2. Recursively sort // 2T(n/2)
    A[1...[n/2]] and A[[n/2]-1...n]
3. Merge 2 sorted lists // linear time (see note)
{% endhighlight %}

Note: here [x] means ${\lceil x \rceil}$. And the thrid step of merge is doing as follow:

Suppose we have two sorted list ${A_1}$ and ${A_2}$. We can just compare the first element of ${A_1}$ and the first element of ${A_2}$, and we will get the smallest elemen. Then we delete the smallest element from original list. Then, for the second-smallest element, we also compare the the first element of ${A_1}$ and the first element of ${A_2}$. So we only need ${n}$ operations to solve the problem. 

So we can get the <b>Recurrence equation</b>:

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
T(n)=
\begin{cases}
\Theta(1), \text{if } n =1  \\
2T(n/2)+\Theta(n), \text{if } n > 1
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

<b>Recursion tree</b> technique:

Here we use ${cn, c>0}$ to represent the ${\Theta(n)}$, so ${T(n)=2T(n/2)+cn}$. And now we write the formula as a tree (see following). 

<p align="center">
    <img src="/post_image/Introduction_to_Algorithm/Lec_1/Lec_1_fig_1.PNG" width="80%">
</p>

And we keep doing that, we end up with this:

<p align="center">
    <img src="/post_image/Introduction_to_Algorithm/Lec_1/lec_1_fig_2.PNG" width="80%">
</p>

First, what's the height (${h}$) of the tree? Actually, this question means How many times do I divide ${ n }$ by 2 to get 1, that is

<center>$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{n}{2^{h}} &= 1 \\
n &= 2^{h} \\
h &= \log_{2} n
\end{aligned}
$$</center>

So, the number of halving of ${ n }$ until we get 1 is ${\lg n}$, that is the height of the tree is ${\lg n +1}$. And, the leaves of the tree is ${n}$. So, we can calculate the total time of the Merge Sort, that is ${T(n)}$, which equals the sum of all notes in the tree.

<center>$$
\begin{aligned}
T(n) &= \lg n \times cn + n\times \Theta(1) \\
&= n \lg n + n \\
&= \Theta(n \lg n)
\end{aligned}
$$</center>
