From today, I will post my study notes of Introduction to Algorithms (following SMA 5503). In the meantime, I am going to finish the assignments in this book and post my solutions coded in both python and C++ (share in my github repository). Besides, I also want to become familiar with C++ during this process.

The web page and videos are available on [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/video_galleries/video-lectures/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/video_galleries/video-lectures/)

The assignments are available on [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/pages/assignments/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/pages/assignments/).

Just in case, I didn't figure out how to solve some problems, I will refer to other solutions. C++ versions are at [https://github.com/walkccc/CLRS-cpp](https://github.com/walkccc/CLRS-cpp) and [https://github.com/Yangjiaxi/ItA](https://github.com/Yangjiaxi/ItA). Python version is at [https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046305/introduction-to-algorithms/](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046305/introduction-to-algorithms/)
