Today, we will introduce a very interesting Algorithm, called "<b>Quicksort</b>", which was invented by Tony Hoare in 1962. 

* It's also a Divide-and-Conquer Algorithm.

* The array will be sorted "<b>in place</b>". (That means Quicksort doesn't need extra array like Mergesort.)  Therefore, it's fairly efficient in its use of storage.

* Very pratical (with tuning)

# Idea of Quicksort

1. "Divide": Partition array into 2 subarray arond pivot ${ x }$, such that 

<center>elems in lower subarray ${ \leq x \leq }$ elems in upper subarray</center>

2. "Conquer": Recursively sort the two subarray. 

3. "Combine": Trivial 

So, the key point is te "Divide" Step. We can treat the Quicksort as recursive partitioning, and the Mergesort is recursive merging. Here, we can give a linear time ${ \Theta(n) }$ partiioning subroutine and give its pseoudocode 

{% highlight pseudocode linenos %}
Partitioning(A,p,q): // treat A[p···q]
    x = A[p] // pivot is A[q]
    i = p // set index
    For j = p+1 to q
        if A[j] <= x 
            i = i + 1
            exchange A[i] with A[j]
    exchange A[i+1] with A[i]
    return i+1
{% endhighlight %}
