# Find Max Subarray

The CLRS textbook talks about an algorithm which can find max subarray in ${ \Theta(n \lg n) }$ time. This algorithm uses Divide-and-Conquer idea, that divides the array into two subarray in each time and compares the max subarry of left part, right part or crossing mid element. So the recurrence is ${ T(n) = 2 T(n/2) + \Theta(n) }$. Here, we indroduce another iterative algorithm that can find the max subarray in ${ \Theta(n) }$, which is the exercise 4.1-5.

<!--more-->

The big picture of this algorithm is suppose we already know the max subarray of ${ A[1 ... j] }$, the maximum subarray of ${ A[1 ... j+1] }$ is either the a maximum subarray of ${ A[1 ... j] }$ or some subarray ${ A[i ... j+1] , 1 \leq i \leq j+1}$. 

In detail, how can we get the max subarray with ${ A[j+1] }$ as the end of subarray, here we called it "Bounded Max Subarray". The Bounded Max Subarray can be got by comparing ${ A[j+1] }$ and the max subarray ${ A[i ... j+1] , 1 \leq i < j+1}$. And the last one we can get by maintain "Bounded Max Subarray". Because, we can add ${ A[j+1] }$ to Bounded Max Subarray of ${ A[1...j] }$.
  
Here we can give the psedocode in the following

{% highlight pseudocode linenos %}
ITERATIVE-FIND-MAXIMUM-SUBARRAY(A)
n = A.length
Bounded_Max = A[1]
Bounded_left = 1
Bounded_right = 1
Max = A[1]
Max_left = 1
Max_right = 1 
for j = 2 to n
    if Bounded_Max + A[j] > A[j]
        Bounded_Max = Bounded_Max + A[j]
        Bounded_right = j
    else
        Bounded_Max = A[j]
        Bounded_left = j
        Bounded_right = j
    if Max < Bounded_Max
        Max = Bounded_Max
        Max_left = Bounded_left
        Max_right = Bounded_right
return Max_left, Max_right, Max
{% endhighlight %}

Then we can easily check the cost of ${ T(n) = \Theta(n) }$

# Multiplication of ${ \mathbb{C} }$ 

Show how to multiply the complex numbers ${ a+bi }$ and ${ c+di }$ using only three multiplications of real numbers. The algorithm should take ${ a, b, c }$ and ${ d }$ as input and produce the real component ${ acâˆ’bd }$ and the imaginary component ${ ad+bc }$ separately.

We can calculate the following middle value

<center>$$
\begin{align}
A = a(d+c) \\
B = b(d+c) \\
C = c(a+b) \\
\end{align}
$$</center>

So, the result is 

<center>$$
(C-B) + (A+B-C)i
$$</center>
