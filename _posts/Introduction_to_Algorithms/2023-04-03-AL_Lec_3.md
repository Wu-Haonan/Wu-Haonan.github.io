This lecture will talk about "Divide-and-Conquer", which is a very powerful algorithm design technique. The main paradigm of it is shown in the following:

* <b>Divede</b>: If we are given some big problem and don't know how to solve it in an efficient way, we can try to solve it into some small sub-problems.

* <b>Conquer</b>: Then we can conquer each problem recursively.

* <b>Combine</b>: Sometings, we need combine the solutions of these subproblems into the solution of the big problem.

# Powering a number

Given a number ${ x \in \mathbb{R}}$, and a integer ${ n \geq 0 }$. Computer ${ x^n }$.

We can use "Divide-and-Conquer" strategy to solve this problem. For ${ x^n }$, we can treat it as ${ x^{n/2} \cdot x^{n/2} }$. So, we just need to solve the ${ x^{n/2} }$, and do one more time of multiplying to get ${ x^n }$. That's the big picture of our idea. Let's show it in detail.

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
x^n = 
\begin{cases}
x^{n/2} \cdot x^{n/2}, \text{ if } x \text{ is odd, } \\
x^{\frac{n-1}{2}} \cdot x^{\frac{n-1}{2}} \cdot x, \text{ if } x \text{ is even }. \\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

Therefore, we can get the recurence of ${ T(n)}$

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
T(n) = 
\begin{cases}
T(\lfloor n/2 \rfloor) + 1, \text{ if } x \text{ is odd, } \\
T(\lfloor n/2 \rfloor) + 2, \text{ if } x \text{ is even, }
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

By Master Theorem, ${ T(n) = T(\lfloor n/2 \rfloor) + \Theta(1) = \lg n }$

# Fibonacci numbers

The definiation of Fibonacci numbers

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
F_n = 
\begin{cases}
0, \text{ if } n = 0 \\
1, \text{ if } n = 1 \\
F_{n-1}+F_{n-2} , \text{ if } n \geq 2
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

## Naive recursive alg.

We can just calculate ${ F_n }$ by recursion. Drawing the recursion tree, we will find that the size of problem only decrease ${ 1 }$ or ${ 2 }$ in each step. Therefore, we can get the running time of this algorithm is ${ T(n) = \Omega(2^{n/2}) }$ and ${ T(n) = O(2^n) }$.

<details><summary>In fact, we can prove ${ T(n) = \Theta(\varphi^n), \varphi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}}$. </summary>

We can get the recurrence is ${ T(n)=T(n-1)+T(n-2)+\Theta(1) }$. And ${ T(0),T(1) }$ is trivial.

If we draw the recursion tree and aligned it to the tree of Fibonacci number. Like the following figure, we can calculate the number of notes.

For each level ${ i }$, we want to calculate its number ${ N(i) }$, which represent ${ F_{n-i+1} }$ in fact. So, we can calculate how many times of ${ F_{n-i+1} }$ appears. Acctually, ${ F_{n-i+1} }$ comes from ${ F_{n-i+2} }$ and ${ F_{n-i+3} }$, therefore the ${ N(i) = N(i-1)+N(i-2) }$. We find that ${ N(n) }$ is also a Fibonacci squence. It's ease to check that the number of leaves is ${ F(n) }$. We denote the sum of the Fibonacci squence as ${  S(n) = \sum_{i=1}^n F(i)}$. And the number of inner notes in the tree is ${ S(n-1) }$. Let's solve the general term fomula of ${ S(n) }$.

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
2S(n) &= (F(1)+F(2)+\cdots+F(n-1)+F(n))+(F(1)+F(2)+\cdots+F(n-1)+F(n)) \\
& = F(1)+(F(1)+F(2)) + (F(2)+F(3)) + (F(3)+F(4)) + \cdots + (F(n-1)+F(n)) + F(n) \\
& = F(1) + F(3) + F(4) + \cdots + F(n) + F(n+1) \\
&= S(n) - F(2) + F(n+1)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

Then, we can get ${ S(n) = F(n+1) - 1 }$. Therefore, ${ T(n) =  F(n)\cdot \Theta(1) + S(n-1)\cdot \Theta(1) = \Theta(F(n))}$

In the last part of this section, we calculate ${ F(n)=\frac{1}{\sqrt {5}} \left(\frac{1+ \sqrt {5}}{2}\right)^n - \frac{1}{\sqrt {5}} \left(\frac{1 - \sqrt {5}}{2}\right)^n }$. So, we can get

<center>$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt {5}} \left(\left(\frac{1+ \sqrt {5}}{2}\right)^n - 1\right) < F(n) + \frac{1}{\sqrt {5}} \left(\left(\frac{1+ \sqrt {5}}{2}\right)^n +1\right) 
$$</center>

Therefore, ${T(n) = \Theta(\varphi^n), \varphi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} }$

</details>

But we want a polynomial algorithm, so let's move forward.

## Bottom-up algorithm

Because in the above algorithm, we calculate a lot of repeat item in the tree. That's not necessary! We can just calculate it from ${ F_1 }$!

{% highlight pseudocode linenos %}
Bottom_up_Fibonacci(n):
    if n == 1 or n == 2
        return 1
    else
        a = 1
        b = 1
        i = 0
        while i < n-2
            c = b
            b = a + b
            a = c
            i++
        return b
{% endhighlight %}

It's easy to check the total running time is ${ T(n) = \Theta(n) }$

## ${ \require{cancel} \bcancel{\text{Naive recursive squaring} } }$

From the following General Term Formula, we can get ${ F_n = [\varphi^n / \sqrt{5}] ,\varphi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}}$. We denote operation ${ [\cdot] }$ as taking the nearest integer.

<b>Ideally</b>, we can use the algorithm in last section to calculate ${ F_n = \varphi^n / \sqrt{5}}$ and take the nearest integer in ${ \Theta(\lg n) }$ time.

However the above operation <b>cannot be finished</b> in a real machine. That's because our computer have to reperent numbers, like ${ \varphi, \sqrt{5}}$, as floating point numbers. That means, we have fixed amount of precise bits, which can not promise we get the correct answer when we take nearest integer!!

## Recursive squaring (${ \checkmark }$)

<details><summary><b> Thm</b>: ${ \left( \matrix{F_{n+1}&F_n\\F_n&F_{n-1}} \right) = \left( \matrix{1&1\\1&0} \right)^n  }$. </summary>

We will prove it by induction

Initially, we will check the base case 

<center>$$
\left( \matrix{F_{2}&F_1\\F_1&F_{0}} \right) = \left( \matrix{1&1\\1&0} \right)^1
$$</center>

Then, we assume statement is true, when ${ n<k }$, now let's check it when ${ n = k }$

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\left( \matrix{F_{n}&F_{n-1}\\F_{n-1}&F_{n-2}} \right)\left( \matrix{1&1\\1&0} \right)
&= \left( \matrix{F_{n}+F_{n-1}&F_{n}+0\cdot F_{n-1}\\F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}&F_{n-1}+0\cdot F_{n-2}} \right)
=\left( \matrix{F_{n+1}&F_n\\F_n&F_{n-1}} \right) \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

By assumption ${ \left( \matrix{F_{n}&F_{n-1}\\F_{n-1}&F_{n-2}} \right) =  \left( \matrix{1&1\\1&0} \right)^{n-1} }$, we can get

<center>$$
\left( \matrix{F_{n+1}&F_n\\F_n&F_{n-1}} \right) = \left( \matrix{1&1\\1&0} \right)^{n}
$$</center>

By induction, we prove our Theorem. <b>Q.E.D</b>

</details>

Therefore, we can computer ${ F_n }$ by nth power of that 2-by-2 matrix. And, the multiplication of two 2-by-2 matrices only need a constant running time. Therefore, we can compute ${ \left( \matrix{1&1\\\1&0} \right)^n }$ in ${ \Theta(\lg n) }$ time by the strategy mentioned in Section \#1.

## General Term Formula

For Fibonacci Sequence, we want to find its General term formula. We want find an appropriate cofficient ${ \lambda }$ to make ${A_n = F_n - \lambda F_{n-1} }$ become a geometrical sequence

<center>$$
F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \Rightarrow F_n - \lambda F_{n-1} = (1-\lambda)F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}
$$</center>

We can solve the equation ${ \frac{1}{-\lambda} =\frac{1-\lambda}{1}}$ to get ${ \lambda = \frac{1\pm \sqrt {5}}{2} }$. We can select ${ \lambda = \frac{1- \sqrt {5}}{2} }$, then the ratio ${ q }$ of ${ A_n }$ is ${ \frac{1+ \sqrt {5}}{2} }$, that means

<center>$$
F_n - \frac{1- \sqrt {5}}{2} \cdot F_{n-1} = \frac{1+ \sqrt {5}}{2}(F_{n-1} - \frac{1- \sqrt {5}}{2} \cdot F_{n-2})
$$</center>

So, we can get ${ A_n = q^{n-2}A_2}$. Hence, we can solve ${ F_n  }$ by ${ F_n -\frac{1- \sqrt {5}}{2} \cdot F_{n-1}= q^{n-2}A_2 }$, that is (note ${ \lambda \cdot q = -1 }$)

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
F_n &=\lambda \cdot F_{n-1} + q^{n-2}A_2 \\
&= \lambda (\lambda \cdot F_{n-2} + q^{n-3}A_2 )+q^{n-2}A_2 \\
&= \lambda^2 \cdot F_{n-2} + \lambda \cdot q^{n-3}A_2 + q^{n-2}A_2\\
& = \lambda^3 \cdot F_{n-3} + \lambda^2 \cdot q^{n-4}A_2+\lambda \cdot q^{n-3}A_2 + q^{n-2}A_2\\
& = \cdots \\
& = \lambda^{n-1}F_1 + A_2(\lambda^{n-2}q^0 +\lambda^{n-3}q^1 +\cdots + \lambda^2 \cdot q^{n-4}+\lambda \cdot q^{n-3} + q^{n-2}) \\
& = \lambda^{n-1}F_1 + A_2\left(\sum_{i=0}^{n-2}q^{n-2}\cdot \left(\frac{\lambda}{q}\right)^i\right)\\
& = \lambda^{n-1}F_1 + A_2 \left(\frac{q^{n-2}(1-\left(\frac{\lambda}{q}\right)^{n-1})}{1-\frac{\lambda}{q}}\right)\\
&= \lambda^{n-1} + A_2 \left( \frac{q^{n-1}-\lambda^{n-1}}{q-\lambda}\right)\\
&= (1-\frac{A_2}{q-\lambda})\lambda^{n-1} + \frac{A_2}{q-\lambda} q^{n-1} \\ 
& = \frac{1}{\sqrt {5}} \left(\frac{1+ \sqrt {5}}{2}\right)^n - \frac{1}{\sqrt {5}} \left(\frac{1 - \sqrt {5}}{2}\right)^n
\end{aligned} 
\end{equation}
$$</center>

# Matrix multiplication

Let's recap the definition of Matrix multiplication. Suppose we have matrix ${ A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}=[a_{ij}], B\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}=[b_{ij}]}$, So ${ C= A\cdot B\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}=[c_{ij}]  }$

<center>$$
c_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^n a_{ik} \cdot b_{kj}
$$</center>

## Standard Algorithm

We can write down an algorithm directly by definition, and the psedocode is shown in the following

{% highlight pseudocode linenos %}
Matrix_Multiplication(A,B):
    n = size_of(A)
    let C be a new n*n matrix
    for i = 1 to n
        for j = 1 to n
            c_ij = 0
            for k = 1 to n
                c_ij = c_ij + a_ik * b _kj
{% endhighlight %}

It's easy to check the above algorithm take ${  \Theta (n^3)}$ running time. 

## Divide-and-conquer alg.

If we consider "Divide-and-conquer" strategy, we will have the following idea: 

For a ${ n\times n }$ matrix, we can treat is a ${ 2\times 2 }$ block matrix of ${ n/2 \times n/2 }$ submatrix (here we suppose ${ n = 2^k, k\in \mathbb{N}^+ }$). We can show it as follow

<center>$$
A = \left[ \matrix{A_{11}& A_{12} \\ A_{21} &A_{22} }\right],
B = \left[ \matrix{B_{11}& B_{12} \\ B_{21} &B_{22} }\right],
C = \left[ \matrix{C_{11}& C_{12} \\ C_{21} &C_{22} }\right]
$$</center>

And, we can check

<center>$$
\left[ \matrix{C_{11}& C_{12} \\ C_{21} &C_{22} }\right] = \left[ \matrix{A_{11}& A_{12} \\ A_{21} &A_{22} }\right] \cdot \left[ \matrix{B_{11}& B_{12} \\ B_{21} &B_{22} }\right],
$$</center>

That means, to calculate ${ C }$, we need to recursively do the following operation

<center>$$
\begin{align}
C_{11} = A_{11}\cdot B_{11} + A_{12}\cdot B_{21} \\
C_{12} = A_{11}\cdot B_{12} + A_{12} \cdot B_{22} \\
C_{21} = A_{21} \cdot B_{11} + A_{22}\cdot B_{21} \\
C_{22} = A_{21} \cdot B_{12} + A_{22}\cdot B_{22}
\end{align}
$$</center>

Notice the above operation, we will find that we need do ${ 8 }$ recursive multiplication of ${ n/2 \times n/2 }$ matrix, and ${ 4 }$ addtion of ${ n/2 \times n/2 }$ matrix. So we can get the recurrence of cost (we add two items in the same postion of two matrix together, which need be done for ${ n^2/4 }$ times)

<center>$$
T(n) = 8 T(n/2) + \Theta(n^2)
$$</center>

By Master theorem, we solve the recurrence ${ T(n) = \Theta (n^{\log_2 8}) = \Theta (n^3) }$. It's a suck result, we don't improve our running time. BUT! The recurrence can give us some inspiration. 

## Strassen Algorithm

The whole idea of Strassen Algorithm is making the cofficient ahead of the ${ T(n/2) }$ become smaller, that means we need to decrease the times of multiplication. To complete it, we don't care about the extra addition opertaion, because it only costs ${ \Theta(n^2) }$ time.

<center>$$
\begin{align}
P_{1} &= A_{11}\cdot (B_{12}-B_{22}) \\
P_{2} &= (A_{11}+A_{12})\cdot B_{22} \\
P_{3} &= (A_{21}+A_{22})\cdot B_{11} \\
P_{4} &= A_{22}\cdot (B_{21}-B_{11}) \\
P_{5} &= (A_{11}+A_{22})\cdot (B_{11}+B_{22}) \\
P_{6} &= (A_{12}-A_{22})\cdot (B_{21}+B_{22}) \\
P_{7} &= (A_{11}-A_{21})\cdot (B_{11}+B_{12}) \\
\end{align}
$$</center>

Then, we can use the above matrices ${ P_1,\cdots ,P_7 }$ to calculate ${ C_{11},C_{12},C_{21},C_{22} }$

<center>$$
\begin{align}
C_{11} &= P_5+P_4-P_2+P_6 \\
C_{12} &= P_1 + P_2 \\
C_{21} &= P_3 + P_4 \\
C_{22} &= P_5+P_1-P_3-P_7 \\
\end{align}
$$</center>

<details><summary>It's trivial to check the correctness, if you're interested, please click the left "${ \blacktriangleright }$" button.</summary>

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
C_{11} &= P_5+P_4-P_2+P_6 \\
&= (A_{11}+A_{22})\cdot (B_{11}+B_{22}) + A_{22}\cdot (B_{21}-B_{11}) - (A_{11}+A_{12})\cdot B_{22} + (A_{12}-A_{22})\cdot (B_{21}+B_{22}) \\
&= A_{11}\cdot B_{11} + \bcancel{A_{11} \cdot B_{22}} +\cancel{A_{22}\cdot B_{11}} + \xcancel{A_{22}\cdot B_{22}} + \bcancel{A_{22}\cdot B_{21}} - \cancel{A_{22}\cdot B_{11}}-\bcancel{A_{11}\cdot B_{22}} - \cancel{A_{12} \cdot B_{22}} \\ & \bcancel{- A_{22}\cdot B_{21}} - \xcancel{A_{22} \cdot B_{22}} + \cancel{A_{12}\cdot B_{22}} + A_{12} \cdot B_{21} \\
&= A_{11}\cdot B_{11} + A_{12} \cdot B_{21}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
C_{12} &= P_1 + P_2 \\
&= A_{11}\cdot (B_{12}-B_{22}) + (A_{11}+A_{12})\cdot B_{22} \\
&= A_{11}\cdot B_{12} + A_{12}\cdot B_{22}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
C_{21} &= P_3 + P_4 \\
&= (A_{21}+A_{22})\cdot B_{11} + A_{22}\cdot (B_{21}-B_{11}) \\
&= A_{21}\cdot B_{11} + A_{22}\cdot B_{21}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
C_{21} &= P_5 + P_1-P_3-P_7 \\
&= (A_{11}+A_{22})\cdot (B_{11}+B_{22}) + A_{11}\cdot (B_{12}-B_{22}) - (A_{21}+A_{22})\cdot B_{11} - (A_{11}-A_{21})\cdot (B_{11}+B_{12}) \\
&= A_{22}\cdot B_{22} + A_{21} \cdot B_{12}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

</details>

Notice that the above operations only take ${ 7 }$ multiplication. So, the recurrence is ${ T(n) = 7 T(n/2) + \Theta(n^2)= \Theta(n^{\log_2 7})=O(n^{2.81}) }$

### PS: how about ${ n }$ is odd

Actually, we will meet the situation that ${ n }$ is odd, so we hit some bumps during using Strassen Algorithm. But, don't worry! We can pad the matrices with zeros to solve it!

We will use the following fact

<center>$$
\left[\matrix{A&0\\0&0}\right] \cdot \left[\matrix{B&0\\0&0}\right] =  \left[\matrix{AB&0\\0&0}\right]
$$</center>

Here the two padded matrices are ${ N\times N }$. In other words, we pad ${ N-n }$ columns and ${ N-n }$ rows of zeros into original matrices.

In practice, we can pad the matrices recursively. When ${ n }$ is odd, we can pad it into ${ (n+1) \times (n+1)  }$ matrix, and call Strassen Algorithm to compute the multiplication.

# VLSI layout Problem.

VLSI (Very Large_Scale Integration) problem is  embed a completed binary tree with ${ n }$ leaves into a grid with minimum area.

## naive embedding

We can first come up a naive idea like the following figure. Therefore, we can write down the recurrence of the height ${ h(n) }$ and width ${ w(n) }$. ${ h(n) = h(n/2) + \Theta(1)=\Theta(\lg n), w(n) = 2w(n/2) + O(1) =\Theta(n) }$. Therefore the area is ${ n \lg n }$.

<p align="center">
    <img src="/post_image/Introduction_to_Algorithm/Lec_3/VLSI.png" width="80%">
</p>

Can we do better? Maybe we can try ${ \Theta(\sqrt {n}) \cdot \Theta(\sqrt {n}) }$!!

So, what kind of recurrence is ${  \Theta(\sqrt {n})}$? We can guess ${ T(n) = 2T(n/4) + O(n^{1/2-\varepsilon}) }$.

## H layout

<p align="center">
    <img src="/post_image/Introduction_to_Algorithm/Lec_3/VLSI_H.png" width="80%">
</p>

Why we take "H", because we want divide ${ n }$ into ${ 4 }$ part! And each part will have ${ n/4 }$ leaves! The root note is the middle！It's easy to check ${ h(n) = 2h(n/4) + \Theta(1)= \Theta(\sqrt {n}),  w(n) = 2w(n/4) + \Theta(1) =  \Theta(\sqrt {n})}$. 

So, we get the area that is ${ \Theta(n)  }$
