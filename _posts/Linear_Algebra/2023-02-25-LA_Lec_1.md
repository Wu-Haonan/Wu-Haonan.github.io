From today, I will post the study notes fo Linear Algebra (following the MIT 18.06). In the meantime, I am going to finish the assignments in this class and post my solutions.

The web page and videos are available on [http://web.mit.edu/18.06/www/](http://web.mit.edu/18.06/www/)

The assignments are available on [http://web.mit.edu/18.06/www/Fall2022/](http://web.mit.edu/18.06/www/Fall2022/) and [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/pages/assignments/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/pages/assignments/)

The fundamental problem of linear algebra is to solve a system of linear equations. First, we will talk about the most normal and nice case, that is "n linear equations, n unknowns".

Take a example

<center>$$
\begin{cases}
2&x-&y=0 \\
-&x+2&y=3
\end{cases}
$$</center>

Then, we can easily get the matrix form, the cofficent of matrix, the vector of unknowns and vector of right hands number.

<center>$$
\left[
\begin{matrix}
2 & -1 \\
-1 & 2 
\end{matrix}
\right]
\left[
\begin{matrix}
x \\
y
\end{matrix}
\right]
=
\left[
\begin{matrix}
0 \\
3
\end{matrix}
\right]
$$</center>

Actually, we often note the above matrix as ${ A }$, the vector of unknowns as ${ \boldsymbol{x} }$  and the right-hand vector ${ b }$, then we get

<center>$$
A \boldsymbol{x} = b 
$$</center>
