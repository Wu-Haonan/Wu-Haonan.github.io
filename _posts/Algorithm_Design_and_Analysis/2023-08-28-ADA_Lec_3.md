## RNA secondary structure

In biology, RNA is a string ${ s_1,\cdots,s_n }$ over ${ \{A,C,G,U\} }$. And, it's tries to form base pairs with itself by folding back.

The set of base pairs formed by RNA moleculars by this process is called "secondary structure". 

Definition: "<b>Secondary Structure</b>" is a set of pairs ${ S = \{ (s_i, s_j) \} }$ satisfying the following properties

1. Watson-Crick rule

Allowed pairs: A-U, U-A, G-C, C-G

2. No sharp turn:

If ${ (s_i, s_j) \in S }$ then ${ i < j - 4 }$

3. No crossing: 

If ${ (s_i,s_j), (s_k ,s_{\ell}) \in S}$, they don't crossing.

* <b>Objective</b>:

Given RNA sequence ${ s_1,\cdots,s_n }$, find a secondary structure ${ S }$ that <b>maximizes</b> the total number of matching pairs.
