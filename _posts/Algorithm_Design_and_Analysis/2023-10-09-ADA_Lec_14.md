This blog will talking about the gready algorithm to solve unweighted and weighted set cover problem. And in the end we will show how to use dual problem to analyze to get better approximation bound.

# Gready algorithm for unweighted set cover

## Algorithm ${ 4 }$

Let ${ \hat{S_j} }$ be set of uncovered items in ${ S_j }$ at any step of any step.

Step 1: ${ I = \emptyset }$, ${\forall j=1,2, \cdots, m }$ let ${ \hat{S_j} = S_j }$

Step 2: while some ${ e_i }$ is uncovered 

* add ${ \ell }$ to ${ I }$, here ${  \lvert \hat{S_{\ell}} \lvert }$ is maximum.

* for all ${ j }$, update ${ \hat{S_j} }$
