From this blog, we will talk about gready algorithm and local search in detail. And this blog will focus on the problem "scheduling jobs with deadlines on a single machine".

# Statement of Problem

- Given $n$ jobs and a machine able to process one job at a time
- Each job is associated with the following parameters:
  1. Process time: $p_j$
  2. Release date: $r_j$
  3. Due date: $d_j$
- If we complete processing job $j$ at time $C_j$ the lateness is: $L_j = C_j - d_j$
- Objective: minimize the maximum lateness: $L_{\text{max}} = \max_{j=1,\ldots,n} L_j$.
- Only decide ${L_{max} \leq 0}$ is a **NP hard** Problem!!!

- $\rho$-approximate algorithm: if $OPT = 0$ algorithm must find solution with objective $\rho \cdot 0 = 0$, implies $P=NP$. Hence, there doesn't exist $\rho$-approximate algorithm unless $P=NP$.

- Hence, we have to consider the **special case**: assume all due dates $d_j$ are negative, implies optimal objective is positive.
