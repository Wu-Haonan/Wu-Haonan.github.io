This blog talks about the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm to solve the max flow problem.

# Gready Alogrithm (idea)

For following flow problem

<p align="center">
    <img src="____" width="60%">
    <br />    <small> tittle </small>
</p>

If we pick up a path and add flow to them, like ${ s \rightarrow u \rightarrow v \rightarrow t }$. We can assign a flow with ${ 20 }$ in this path. And, we will find, we can not find another path to add flow. But, the below one is the max flow. So, what should I do to change the right one to below one?

We need a chance to <b>modify</b> our anwser. We hope to withdraw the flow on edge ${ (u,v) }$. This observation leads to the idea of <b>"Residual Graph"</b> and Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.

# Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm

## Residual Graph

Given a graph ${ G }$ and a flow ${ f }$, we can define the <b>"Residual Graph"</b> ${ G_f  = (V_f,E_f)}$.

We keep all the nodes from ${ G }$ in ${ G_f }$. But for each edge in ${ G }$, we will define a backward edge for original edge (forward edge). We define the edge ${ E_f }$ as follow

<center>$$
E_f = \{(u,v) \in E | f((u,v)) < c((u,v))\} \cup \{(v,u)|(u,v) \in E, f((u,v)) > 0 \}
$$</center>

And we assign capacity to each edge in ${ G_f }$ as below

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
c_f((u,v)) = 
\begin{cases}
c((u,v)) - f((u,v)), & \text{ if } (u,v) \in \{(u,v) \in E | f((u,v)) < c((u,v))\} \\
f((u,v)), & \text{ if } (u,v) \in \{(v,u)|(u,v) \in E, f((u,v)) > 0 \}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

## Augmenting Path

We define a path as <b>Augmenting Path</b> if this path exists in residual graph ${ G_f }$.

We can easy to have the following observation. 

Observation: If there exists an augmenting path in residue graph ${ G_f }$, then the current flow is not yet a max flow. 

We will use this observation to design Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm. And we will prove it later. 

## Pseudocode

The basic idea of algorithm is 

1. Finding a path ${ P }$ in the residual graph.

2. Finding the bottleneck capacity ${ b }$ of ${ P }$. 

3. Augment flow of value ${ b }$ along ${ P }$.

4. Construct the new residual graph and continue until the current residual graph has no ${ s-t }$ path.

Here I will give the pseudocode as below

{% highlight pseudocode linenos %}
Ford-Fulkerson(G,s,t,C)
    for each e in E
        f(e) = 0
    G_f = Residual(G,f)
    while (there exists augmenting path P in G_f)
        f = Augment_Flow(f,c,P)
        G_f = Residual(G,f)
    return f

Augment_Flow(f,c,P)
    b = bottleneck capacity of P
    for each e in P
        if e in E
            f(e) = f(e) + b
        else // e is backeard edge
            f(e) = f(e) - b
    return f

Residual(G,f)
    E_f = E
    for each e in E
        if 0 < f(e) < c(e)
            c(e) = c(e) - f(e)
            E_f = E_f + {e}
            c(e) = f(e)
        else if f(e) = c(e)
            E_f = E_f - {e} + {e_R}
            c(e_R) = f(e)
    G_f = G(V,E_f,C)
    return G_f
{% endhighlight %}

## Correctness



### Lemma 1 flow is valid

### Output flow is maximum

## Running time 

Assumption:

1. All capacities are integers and each capacity equals and less than ${ C }$.

2. Every flow value ${ f(e) }$ are integers.

The algorithm needs at most ${ mC }$ iterations. And each iteration takes time ${ O(m+n) = O(m) }$. And the total time is ${ O(m^2 C) }$. It's a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm.
