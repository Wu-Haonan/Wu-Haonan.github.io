This blog talks about a polynomial time algorithm to Max flow problem, called ${ \Delta }$-Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm.

## Pseudocode

## Correctness

## Running time 

Assumption:

1. All capacities are integers and each capacity equals and less than ${ C }$.

2. Every flow value ${ f(e) }$ are integers.

<b>Lemma 1</b>: The number of loops is ${ 1+ \lceil \lg C \rceil }$

<b>Lemma 2</b>: Let ${ f }$ be the flow at the end of some ${ \Delta }$ phase. Then if ${ f_{max} }$ be the max flow then

<center>$$
v(f_{max}) \leq v(f) + m \Delta
$$</center>

Proof.

We will show in ${ \Delta }$ phase, ${ \exists }$ cut ${ (A,B) }$ s.t.

<center>$$
Cap(A,B) \leq v(f) + m \Delta
$$</center>

Now we construct cut ${ (A,B) }$ as follow:

<b>Lemma 3</b>: There are at most ${ 2m }$ augmentations in each iteration.
