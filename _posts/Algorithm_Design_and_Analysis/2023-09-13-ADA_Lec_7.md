This blog talks about two applications of Max flow problem, that are bipartite matching problem and edge-disjoint path problem

## Reduction

### Definition of Reduction

Problem ${ X }$ reduces to Problem ${ Y }$, ${ \underset{\text{p}}{\leq} }$ means that if ${ \exists }$ a polynomial algorithm that given any instance ${x  }$ of ${ X }$, converts ${ x }$ to an instance ${ y \in Y }$ s.t. the solution of ${ y }$ can be converted to a solution of ${ x }$.
