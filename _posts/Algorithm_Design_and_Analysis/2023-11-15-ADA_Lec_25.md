# Selection Problem and LazySelect

Given unsorted list $S$ with $n = \vert S \vert$ distinct elements, and ${k \in \\{1, \ldots, n\\}}$, find ${S_{(k)}}$, which is the $k$th element of S in sorted order.

For $y \in S$, let $r_S(y) := \vert \{y' \in S \mid y' \leq y\} \vert$ be the **rank** of $y$ in $S$. The equivalent goal is to find $y \in S$ such that $r_S(y) = k$.

Observe that $r_S(S_{(k)}) = k$ and $S_{r_S(y)} = y$. (Because, all the elements are distinct).

Then, we give the pseudocode of LazySelect Algorithm as below

   01: function LAZYSELECT(S, k) <br>
   02:     &emsp; repeat <br>
   03:      &emsp; &emsp;   R ← random ${n^{3/4}}$ elements from S, picked uniformly at random with replacement. <br>
   04:       &emsp; &emsp;  Sort R in $O(\vert R \vert \ln \vert R \vert)$ steps. <br>
   05: 	&emsp; &emsp;x ← $kn^{-1/4}$, $\ell$ ← ${\max \\{\lfloor x - \sqrt{n} \rfloor , 1\\}}$, $a$ ← $R_{(\ell)}$, $h$ ← ${\min \\{ \lceil x - \sqrt{n} \rceil , 1\\}}$, $b$ ← $R_{(h)}$. By comparing a and b to every $s \in S$, find $r_S(a)$ and $r_S(b)$. <br/>
   06:     &emsp; &emsp;    $$P \leftarrow \begin{cases}       \{y \in S \mid y \leq b\} & \text{if } k < n^{3/4} \\       \{y \in S \mid \leq y \leq b\} & \text{if } k \in [n^{3/4}, n - n^{3/4}] \\       \{y \in S \mid a \leq y\} & \text{if } k > n - n^{3/4}       \end{cases}$$ <br/>
   07:     &emsp;until $S_{(k)} \in P$ and $\vert P \vert < 4n^{3/4} + 2$ <br/>
   08:   &emsp;  Sort P in $O(\vert P \vert \ln \vert P \vert)$ steps. <br/>
   09:   &emsp;  return $P_{(k-r_S(a)+1)}$  // This is $S_{(k)}$.

# Explanation of Algorithm

* First, we randomly select ${n^{3/4}}$ elements from ${S}$ and construct list ${R}$. 
* Second, we sort ${R}$ in  $O(\vert R \vert \ln \vert R \vert)$ time. 
* The likely position of ${S_{(k)}}$ in ${R}$ is ${x = n^{3/4} \cdot \frac{k}{n} = k n^{-1/4}}$. So, here we select a range around position ${x}$, that is $\ell$ ← ${\max \\{\lfloor x - \sqrt{n} \rfloor , 1\\}}$,  $h$ ← ${\min \\{ \lceil x - \sqrt{n} \rceil , 1\\}}$. And, we can pick up corresponding element $a$ ← $R_{(\ell)}$, $b$ ← $ R_{(h)}$.
* Then, we can compare all the elements from $S$ to $a$ and $b$. In the meantime, we can divide $S$ into three categories ${y<a, y\in [a,b],y>b}$.
* Then, we construct list $P$, in fact we don't need extra computation, we can select it by above step.
  * If $k$ is small, that is $k<n^{3/4}$, then we pick up $y \leq b$. 
  * If $k$ is in the middle, that is $n^{3/4} < k < n - n^{3/4}$, then we pick up $ a \leq y \leq b$. 
  * If $k$ is large, that is $k> n - n^{3/4}$, then we pick up $y \geq a$. 
* If $P$ contains $S_{(k)}$, and size is small, that is $\vert P \vert < 4n^{3/4} + 2$. We will continue following steps.
* Sort ${P}$ in  $O(\vert P \vert \ln \vert P \vert)$ time. 
* Then, we can get ${S_{(k)}}$ by shifting in list ${P}$, that is $P_{(k-r_S(a)+1)}$.

# LazySelect Analysis

**Lemma:** Let ${X_{(i)} = \vert \\{ y \in R \mid y \leq S_{(i)} \\}\vert}$. Hence we have
$$
S_{(i)} < R_{(j)} \Leftrightarrow X_{(i)} < j
$$

**Proof.** 

${\Rightarrow}$: If ${S_{(i)} < R_{(j)}}$, we know there at most ${j-1}$ elements in ${R}$ that are less or equal to ${S_{(i)}}$. So, ${X_{(i)} \leq j-1}$, that implies ${X_{(i)} < j}$.

${\Leftarrow}$: If ${X_{(i)} < j}$, we know there at most ${j-1}$ elements in ${R}$ that are less or equal to ${S_{(i)}}$. So, ${S_{(i)} \leq R_{(j-1)}}$, that means ${S_{(i)} < R_{(j)}}$. ${\square}$




**Theorem: ** With probability at least ${1-n^{-1/4}}$, LazySelect can find ${S_{(k)}}$ after running the loop for only once, and thus it does only ${2n+o(n)}$ comparisons. 

**Proof.** First, we can compute the running time of the algorithm. If the algorithm finished in one loop, we take ${2n}$ comparisons from computing ${r_s(a)}$ and ${r_s{(b)}}$ (we need compare ${a,b}$ to each element in ${S}$) and ${\mathcal{O}(n^{3/4}\ln n)}$ for sorting lists ${R}$ and ${P}$ [(and ${\mathcal{O}(n^{3/4}\ln n )= \mathcal{o}}(n)$)](https://wu-haonan.github.io/2023/03/05/AL_Lec_2.html#-o--and--omega--notation). 

Following, we need to show LazySelect can find ${S_{(k)}}$ after running the loop for only once with high probability.  Here, we assume ${n^{3/4}}$ is an integer and only prove the cases ${n^{3/4} < k < n - n^{3/4}}$. The other two cases are similar and simpler. 

Assume ${n^{3/4} < k < n - n^{3/4}}$, then ${x \in [\sqrt{n},n^{3/4}-\sqrt{n}]}$. And we have two ways to fail:

Type Ⅰ: ${S_{(k)}\notin P}$

Type Ⅱ: ${S_{(k)}\in P \land \vert P \vert >  \lfloor 4 n^3/4 + 2 \rfloor}$ 

So, we have

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\Pr [\text{multiple runs}] &= \Pr[S_{(k)} \notin P \lor \vert P \vert > \lfloor 4 n^3/4 + 2 \rfloor] \\
& = \Pr[S_{(k)} \notin P] + \Pr[\vert P \vert > \lfloor 4 n^3/4 + 2 \rfloor] - \Pr[S_{(k)} \notin P \land \vert P \vert > \lfloor 4 n^3/4 + 2 \rfloor]\\
&= \Pr[(S_{(k)} \notin P \land \vert P \vert > \lfloor 4 n^3/4 + 2 \rfloor) \lor ((S_{(k)} \in P \land \vert P \vert > \lfloor 4 n^3/4 + 2 \rfloor)] \\
& \quad + \Pr[S_{(k)} \notin P] - \Pr[S_{(k)} \notin P \land \vert P \vert > \lfloor 4 n^3/4 + 2 \rfloor]\\ 
& = \Pr[(S_{(k)} \notin P \land \vert P \vert > \lfloor 4 n^3/4 + 2 \rfloor)] + \Pr[(S_{(k)} \in P \land \vert P \vert > \lfloor 4 n^3/4 + 2 \rfloor)] \\
& \quad + \Pr[S_{(k)} \notin P] - \Pr[S_{(k)} \notin P \land \vert P \vert > \lfloor 4 n^3/4 + 2 \rfloor]\\
& = \Pr[(S_{(k)} \in P \land \vert P \vert > \lfloor 4 n^3/4 + 2 \rfloor)]  + \Pr[S_{(k)} \notin P] \\
& = \Pr[\text{Type I}] + \Pr[\text{Type II}]
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

Hence, we can calculate the upper bound of ${\Pr[\text{Type I}] }$ and ${\Pr[\text{Type II}]}$.

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\Pr[S_{(k)} \notin P] = \Pr[S_{(k)} < a] + \Pr[S_{(k)} > a]
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

We denote ${k_{\ell} = \max \{1, k - 2 n^{3/4}\}}$ and ${k_h = \min \{k+ 2n^{3/4}, n\}}$, then:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
 \Pr[(S_{(k)} \in P \land \vert P \vert > \lfloor 4 n^3/4 + 2 \rfloor)] \leq \Pr[S_{(k_\ell)} > a] + \Pr[S_{(k_h)} < b] 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

(Note: here ${k}$ is the median in ${P}$ with high probability, so it's upper bound is at least ${S_{(k_\ell)} > a}$ or ${S_{(k_h)} < b}$ is true.)

Let ${X_i}$ indicate that the ${i}$th element picked for ${R}$ is less or equal to ${S_{k}}$. 

Now, we compute the upper bound of probability of Type Ⅰ.
