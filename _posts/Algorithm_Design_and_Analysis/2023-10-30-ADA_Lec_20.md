From this blog, we will talk about "rounding data" strategy and dynamic programing applied in approximation algorithm in detail. And this blog will focus on the problem "scheduling jobs on identical parallel macines".

# Polynomial time approximation Scheme (PTAS)

<b>Definition</b>: A polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) is a family of algorithms ${ A_{\epsilon} }$, where there is an algorithm for each ${ \epsilon \geq 0}$, such that ${ A_{\epsilon} }$ is a ${(1+\epsilon)  }$-approximation algorithm (for minimization problems) or a ${(1-\epsilon)  }$-approximation algorithm (for maximization problems)

We should noticed that

1. Running time depends on ${ \epsilon }$, for fixing ${ \epsilon }$, the runing time is a polynomial function of ${ n }$.

2. PTAS is stronger than other approximation, because there is no lower bound on the approximation ratio.

# Problem Definition and whole idea

## Definition of problem

Given ${ n }$ jobs and ${ m }$ machines each able to process one job at a time. 

Each job is associated with a process time ${ p_j }$. All jobs are available at time ${ 0 }$.

We need to assign all the ${ n }$ jobs to ${ m }$ machines. Denote the time that job ${ j }$ is completed as ${ C_j }$.

The objective is minimize the makespan ${ C_{max} = \max_j C_j }$.

## Big picture of idea

1. First we will split the jobs into two kinds -- long jobs and short jobs. We will show <b>if</b> we can schedule these long jobs with ${ (1+\epsilon) }$-approximation, then the result is <b>still ${ (1+\epsilon) }$-approximation</b> after scheduling these short jobs.

2. So we move to how to scheduling long jobs with ${ (1+\epsilon) }$-approximation. We can give a series time ${ T }$ and find an algorithm to <b>check if we can finish all the jobs in given time ${ T }$</b>. We select a series of ${ T }$ like ${ 1, (1+\epsilon), (1+\epsilon)^2, \cdots, (1+\epsilon)^n }$, and we find the minimum ${ T^\* }$ such that we can complete all the jobs, that will guarantee ${ (1+\epsilon) }$-approximation.

3. Now we need to find an algorithm to check if we can finish all the jobs in given time ${ T }$. We will take the <b>rounding strategy</b>. We will round process time of each job ${ j }$ as ${ \lfloor \frac{p_j}{\mu} \rfloor}$, so each process time is a multiple of ${ \mu }$, it's more easy to apply Dynamic Programming. And we also prove that <b>if</b> we can schedule these rounding jobs with ${ (1+\epsilon) }$-approximation, then the scheduling plan is <b>still ${ (1+\epsilon) }$-approximation</b> for original jobs. 

4. Then, we will design the <b>Dynamic Programming</b> algorithm for rounding jobs and prove it can be done in polynomial time.
