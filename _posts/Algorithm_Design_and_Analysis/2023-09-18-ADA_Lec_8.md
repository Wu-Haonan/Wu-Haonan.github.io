The following blogs we will talks about the Hardness of Probelms and P, NP, NPC problems.

# Catalogs of Problems

Here we only give some intuitional definition, and in the following blogs, we will give their rigorous one. 

* ${ P =}$ Problems with polytime algorithm.

* ${ NP =}$ Problems whose answers are easy to (in polynimial time) to verify.

* <b>Reduction</b>: ${ X }$ reduced to ${ Y }$ ${ \Rightarrow }$ ${ Y }$ is  at least as hard as ${ X }$. And denoted as ${ X \leq_p Y }$

* ${ NP}$-${ Complete }$: ${ Y }$ is ${ NPC }$ if

    1. ${ Y \in NP }$
    2. ${ \forall X \in NP, X \leq_p Y }$

* ${ EXP= }$ Problems having algorithms with exponential run time.

# Polynimial Reduction (Cook, Karp)

Now we will formally define "Reduction". In fact, we have several ways to define it. Here we introduce two definition.

<b>Cook Reduction</b>: Problem ${ X }$ polynomial reduces to problem ${ Y }$ (${ X \leq_p Y }$) if any arbitrary instances of ${ X }$ can be solved using

1. a polynomial number of standard computational steps, plus

2. a polynomial number of calls to the algorithm/oracle that solves problem ${ Y }$

Note: here we use "oracle" this word, in fact this word has a more rigorous definition. But here we can undertand it as a "black box" that can solve ${ Y }$. Because, for some problems, we haven't have any algorithm to solve it. But, we want to describe their relation (respect to hardness).

<b>Karp Reduction</b>: Problem ${ X }$ polynomial reduces to problem ${ Y }$ if given any instance ${ x }$ of ${ X }$, we can convert it to an instance ${ y }$ of ${ Y }$, such that

1. ${ \vert y \vert}$ is polynimial of ${ \vert x \vert}$ (that means construct ${ y }$ by ${ x }$ in polynomial time)

2. ${ x }$ is a ${ yes }$ instance of ${ X }$ <b>if and only if</b> ${ y }$ is a ${ yes }$ instance of ${ y }$.

First, Karp reduction only apply to decision problems. 

Next, we noticed that karp reduction call oracle for ${ y }$ only once! But cook reduction permits us call oracle for ${ y }$ polynomial times. So, Karp is more restricted to Cook reduction. 

But until now it seems all the Cook reduction is also satisify Karp reduction, we don't prove whether they are equivalence. 

In following discussion, we will only use <b>Cook reduction</b>.

Hence, we can immediatly get following three claims by the definition of <b>Reduction</b>

<b>Claim 1</b>: If ${ X \leq_p Y }$, and ${ Y }$ has a polynomial time algorithm then ${ X }$ can be solved in polynomial time.

<b>Claim 2</b>: If ${ X \leq_p Y }$, and ${ X }$ cannot be solved in a polynomial time algorithm then ${ Y }$ cannot be solved in polynomial time.

<b>Claim 3</b>: If ${ X \leq_p Y, Y \leq_p X }$, ${ X }$ can be solved in polynomial time <b>iff</b> ${ Y }$ can be solved in polynomial time.

# Decision Problems

In previous problems, we have a lot of search/optimization problem, that is we find some best solution from a set of possible solution. Like Min Cut, Max Flow,Chromatic number.

<details><summary>What is Chromatic number problem?</summary> (Given a graph ${ G }$, the chromatic number is the minumum number of colors required to color each vertex of ${ G }$ such that no two adjacent vertices get the same color.)</details>

But we can give above problems in their decision version. Here we introduce <b>decision problem</b>.

<b>Definition</b>：A <b>decision problem</b> is a computational problem that can be posed as a yes–no question of the input values.

Like, the decision version of Max Flow problem is ${ ((G,s,t,C),k) }$, that means for max flow problem ${ (G,s,t,C) }$ whether exists a flow with value as ${  k}$.

Another example, the decision version of Chromatic number is ${ (G,k) }$, whether we can use ${ k }$ kinds of colors to color the graph vertex.

## Reduction from Search Prob to Decision Prob

It is obviously to know if we solve the search problem, we can immediately get the anwser of Decision problem. (Like Chromatic number, if we already know the Chromatic number ${ \chi }$ of graph ${ G }$, we can easily get the anwser of ${ (G,k) }$, ${ yes }$ iff ${ k \geq \chi }$). 

But, if we already solve the decision problem, can we get the anwser of search problem in polynomial time?

Yes, we can. We can solve all the decision version of Chromatic problem ${ (G,k) , k\in \\{1,2,\cdots,n\\}}$. Here ${ n = \vert V \vert }$. We only need call algorithm of decision version of Chromatic problem polynomial times ${ O(n) }$. If we use binary search, we can do better by calling ${ O(\lg n) }$ times.

# Reduction Techniques

Following, we will give some common techniques to prove reduction. We will show each technique by an example.

* Reduction by Equivalence

* Reduction from special cases to general case

* Reduction via gadgets 

## Reduction by Equivalence

### Vertex Cover Problem

Given an undirected graph ${ G=(V,E) }$, a vertex cover of ${ G }$ is the subset of nodes ${ V' \subseteq V }$, such that ${ \forall e = (u,v) \in E }$ at least one of ${ u,v }$ is in ${ V' }$. And vertex cover problem is to find the minimum size of vertex cover in graph ${ G }$.

Decision Version: ${ <G;k> = \\{\text{All the graphs has a vertex cover of size } k\\} }$. ${ G' \in <G;k> }$ iff ${ (G',k) }$ is ${ yes }$ instance.

### Independent Set Problem

Given an undirected graph ${ G=(V,E) }$, an independent set of ${ G }$ is a subset of vertices ${ V' \subseteq V }$, such that no two vertices in ${ V' }$ are adjacent in ${ G }$ (there is no edge in ${ V' }$). And Independent Set Problem is to find the maximum size of independent set in graph ${ G }$. 

Decision Version: ${ <G;k> = \\{\text{All the graphs has a independent of size } k\\} }$. ${ G' \in <G;k> }$ iff ${ (G',k) }$ is ${ yes }$ instance.

### Vertex Cover ${ =_p }$ Independet Set

We will show they can reduce to each other by prove the equivalence of vertex cover and independent set. We have following Claim.

<b>Claim</b>: ${ S }$ is an independent set (IS) iff ${ V \setminus S }$ is a vertex cover (VC).

Proof. we will prove the neccesity and sufficiency separately.

${ \Rightarrow }$: Let ${ S }$ be an IS. ${ \forall e =(u,v) \in E }$, either ${ u }$ or ${ v \notin S }$. So, either ${ u }$ or ${ v \in V\setminus S }$. Hence, we prove ${ V\setminus S }$ cover all the edges, which is a vertex cover of ${ G }$.

${ \Leftarrow }$: Let ${ C }$ be a VC. Let's check ${ V \setminus C }$ is a IS. Assum ${ (u,v) \in E, u,v \in  V \setminus C }$. That means ${ u,v \notin  C }$, which contradicts to ${ C }$ is a vertex cover. ${ \square }$

## Sum-up

In fact, "Reduction by Equivalence" is try to prove the relation in math of the two problems. Like vertex cover and independent set, they just like the two sides of a coin. 

## Reduction from special cases to general case

### Set Cover Problem

### Vertex Cover ${ \leq_p }$ Set Cover

## Reduction via gadgets
