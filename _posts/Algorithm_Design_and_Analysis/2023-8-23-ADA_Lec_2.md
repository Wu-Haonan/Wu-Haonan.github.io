This lecture continues to talk about Dynamic Programming, we are going to introduce Knapsack Problem and Fibonacci number problem.

## Knapsack Problem

Give ${ n }$ objects and a knapsack

* item ${ i }$ has weighted ${ w_i > 0 }$ and value ${ v_i > 0 }$

* knapsack capacity is ${ W }$

* Goal: Fill the knapsack to maximize the total value.

### Dynanmic Programming

We can not ... one variable ...

So, we use two varible

${ i \in [1,\cdots , n] , w \in [0, \cdots, W]}$

Definition: 

${ OPT(i, w) = }$ maximum profit on items ${ \{ 1,\cdots, i \} }$ within wright capacity ${ w }$



Case 1 OPT does not include item ${ i }$

<center>$$
OPT(i,w) = OPT(i-1,w)
$$</center>

OPT should maximize the profit on items ${ \{1,\cdots, i -1 \}  }$ with capacity ${ w }$

Case 2 

If ${w_i \leq w  }$

OPT should maxm the profit on items 

 ${ max\{ OPT(i-1, w), v_i + OPT(i-1,w-w_i) \} }$

 ${ M_{n \times W} }$: 

Base cases ${ M(i,0) = 0, M(0,w) = 0 }$
