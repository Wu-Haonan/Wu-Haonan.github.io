```pseudocode

RNA_Folding(s_1,s_2,...,s_n)
    // Initialization DP matrix
    for i = 1 ... n 
        for j = 1 ... n
            M[i,j] = 0
    for k = 5,6,...,n-1 //iterate all the distance of interval
        for i = 1...n-k //iterate all the starting position
            j = i + k

    Return M[1,n]

    for t = i,i+1,...,j-5
        if s_t and s_j are matched
            M[i,j] = max{M[i,j],1+M[i,t-1]+M[t+1,j-1]} //We keep M[i,j] store maxinum in each comparision, finnaly we get the maxinum for all situation. If there is no s_t to match s_j, M[i,j] still keep 0
