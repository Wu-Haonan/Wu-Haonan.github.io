This blog, we still talk about randomized algorithms. Let's consider the parallel computation problem: A network of parallel processors is modeled by a directed graph ${G = (N, E)}$. The nodes ${N}$ represent the processors and the edges ${E}$ model the communication links between the processors. All communication between processors occurs in synchronous steps. Each link can carry at most one unit message (packet) in one step. During a step, a processor can send at most one packet to each of its neighbors. Each processor is uniquely identified by a number between 1 and ${N}$.

# Permutation Routing Problem

We can abstract the above problem to following statement.

Given a directed graph on ${N}$ nodes, where each node ${i}$ initially contains one *packet* destined for some node ${d(i)}$, s.t. ${d(\cdot)}$ is a permutation. In each *step*, every edge can carry a single packet. A node that may send a packet on each outgoing edge (if it has the packets).

A ***route*** for a packet is a list of edges it can follow from its source to its destination.

If two packets want to use the same edge, one may have to wait. The ***queueing discipline*** for an algorithm is how it decides which packet goes first.

An ***oblivious algorithm*** for the permutation routing problem satisfies the following property: if the route followed by the packet starting at $v_i$ depends only on $d(i)$, not on $d(j)$ for any $j \neq i$. (Note: Oblivious routing algorithms are attractive for their simplicity of implementation : the communication hardware at each node in the network can determine the next link on its route, simply by looking at the source and destination information carried by a packet.)

## Lower bound of oblivious algorithm

**Theorem 1.1** For any deterministic oblivious permutation routing algorithm on a network of ${N}$ nodes each of out-degree ${d}$, there is an instance of permutation routing requiring $\Omega \left( \sqrt{\frac{N}{d}} \right)$ steps [^1].

Its proof is beyond the scope of this blog.
