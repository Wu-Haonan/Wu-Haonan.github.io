This blog is talking about how to solve linear optimization problems involving two decision variables graphically.

# LO problems involving 2 decision variables.

Consider a linear function ${ f:\mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R} }$

<center>$$
f(\bar{x}) = \bar{c}^T \bar{x}
$$</center>

Let's look at the <b>level sets</b> of the function ${ f }$. 

<center>$$
f^{-1}(0) = \{\bar{x}| 0=f(\bar{x} \} = \{\bar{x}| 0=\bar{c}^T \bar{x} \}
$$</center>

<p align="center">

</p>

In fact, all the points that satisfy ${ f(\bar{x}) = 0 }$ form a line that is perpendicular to ${\bar{c}  }$ (here ${ \bar{c} \neq \bar{0}}$). So, we can have

<center>$$
f^{-1}(0) = (\text{span}\{\bar{c}\})^{\perp}
$$</center>


Observation: Two vectors ${ \bar{p},\bar{q} \in \mathbb{R}^2 }$ are in the same level set of the linear function ${ f }$ iff

<center>$$
f(p) = f(q) \\
p - q \top \bar{c}
$$</center>

Thus the level set of function ${ f = c^T x }$ are the linear orthogonal to ${ span\{\bar{c}\} }$

What is the value set of linear function ${ f=c^Tx }$ associate with value ${ K }$

<center>$$
x \in f^-1(K) \Leftrightarrow f(x) = K
$$</center>

<center>$$
\Vert c \Vert \Vert x \Vert \cos \theta = K
$$</center>

<center>$$
\Vert x \Vert \cos \theta = \frac{K}{\Vert c \Vert}
$$</center>

Hence ${ f^-1(K) }$ is the linear orthogonal to ${ span\{c\} }$ located at <u>signed</u> distance ${ \frac{K}{\Vert c \Vert} }$ from the origin (${ \bar{0} }$) in the directio of ${ \bar{c} }$


Draw the solution of the linear inequality ${ 2x_1+ x_2 \geq 6 }$

It's the union of all the level sets of the linear function ${ (x_1,x_2) \mapsto 2x_1 + x_2 }$ corrsponding to all the values ${ 6 }$ and higher

STEP 1: Draw ${ 2x_1+ x_2 = 6 }$

STEP 2: ${ \geq 6 }$ along the direction of vector ${ c }$ the value increases


# Geometry of polyhedra

A polyhedron is a subset of ${ \mathbb{R}^n }$ of the form ${ \{\bar{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n | A \bar{x} \geq \bar{b} \} }$

Where ${ A }$ is a ${ m \times n }$ matrix and ${ \bar{b} }$ is a vector in ${ \mathbb{R}^m }$

A subset of ${ \mathbb{R}^n }$ is called a polyhedron in standard form representation. 

A polyhedron can either "extend to infinity" or be confined in a finite region.
