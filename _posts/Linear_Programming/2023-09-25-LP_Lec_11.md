This blog is talking about the concept of <b>degeneracy</b>. Which is actually a horrible situation in following algorithm called simplex we will going to talk about.

# Degeneracy

Consider the polyhedron in ${ \mathbb{R}^n }$ determined by the linear constraints

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\bar{a_i}^\top \bar{x} &\leq b_i, \forall i \in L \\
\bar{a_i}^\top \bar{x} &= b_i, \forall i \in E \\
\bar{a_i}^\top \bar{x} &\geq b_i, \forall i \in G \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

Given a point ${ \bar{y}\in \mathbb{R}^n }$, let 

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
L_{\bar{y}} = \{i\in L \mid \bar{a_i}^\top \bar{y} = b_i\} \\
E_{\bar{y}} = \{i\in E \mid \bar{a_i}^\top \bar{y} = b_i\} \\
G_{\bar{y}} = \{i\in G \mid \bar{a_i}^\top \bar{y} = b_i\} \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

be the subsets of indices corresponding to the linear constraints that are active at ${ \bar{y} }$.

Recall that the point ${ \bar{y} }$ is a basic solution, <b>iff</b> ${E_{\bar{y}}= E}$ and ${\dim  \text{ } span \\{\bar{a_i} \mid i \in E\cup L_{\bar{y}} \cup G_{\bar{y}}\\} = n}$.

Assume ${\bar{y}}$ is a basic solution, we have 

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
 n &= \dim  \text{ } span \{\bar{a_i} \mid i \in E\cup L_{\bar{y}} \cup G_{\bar{y}}\} \\
&\leq \dim  \text{ } span \{\bar{a_i} \mid i \in E\} +  \dim  \text{ } span \{\bar{a_i} \mid i \in L_{\bar{y}} \cup G_{\bar{y}} \} \\
& \leq  \dim  \text{ } span \{\bar{a_i} \mid i \in E\} + \# (L_{\bar{y}} \cup G_{\bar{y}})
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

We now have ${ n \leq   \dim  \text{ } span \\{\bar{a_i} \mid i \in E\\} + \\#(L_{\bar{y}} \cup G_{\bar{y}})}$, or equivalently,

<center>$$
\#(L_{\bar{y}} \cup G_{\bar{y}}) \geq n- \dim  \text{ } span \\{\bar{a_i} \mid i \in E\\}
$$</center>

Here, ${ \\#(L_{\bar{y}} \cup G_{\bar{y}}) }$ is the number of ineqaulity constraints active at ${\bar{y}}$.

${ n- \dim  \text{ } span \\{\bar{a_i} \mid i \in E\\}}$ means the dimension of the solution set of the linear system ${A\bar{x}=\bar{b}}$.

<b>Definition:</b> If the above inequality is strictly larger, we say ${\bar{y}}$ is a <b>degenarate</b> basic solution. Else, we take equal here, we say ${\bar{y}}$ is a <b>non-degenarate</b> basic solution.

# Degeneracy in Geometric

In fact, we noticed that the degeneracy situation happens to the basic solution that are over-determined, that means the the number of hyperplanes that are passing through ${\bar{y})}$ is greater than the dimension of whole space.

# Degenerate basic solution in Std form

<b>Definition</b>: Given a basic solution ${\bar{y}}$ of a standard form polyhedron ${P = \\{\bar{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid A\bar{x} = \bar{b}, \bar{x}\geq \bar{0}\\}}$. We say that ${\bar{y}}$ is a <b>degenerate basic solution</b> if 

<center>$$
\#(L_{\bar{y}} \cup G_{\bar{y}}) > n- \dim  \text{ } span \{\bar{a_i} \mid i \in E\}
$$</center>

i.e. more than ${n-rank(A)}$ of components of ${\bar{y}}$ are zero.

# Observation

* At a non-degenerate basic solution of a std form polyhedron ${P=\\{\bar{x}\in \mathbb{R}^n \mid A\bar{x} = \bar{b},\bar{x}\geq \bar{0}\\}}$, exactly  ${n-rank(A)}$ constraints ${x_i \geq 0}$ are active, namely all ${n-rank(A)}$ non-basic variables are zero and all basic variables are non-zero.

* At a degenerate basic solution of a std form polyhedron ${P=\\{\bar{x}\in \mathbb{R}^n \mid A\bar{x} = \bar{b},\bar{x}\geq \bar{0}\\}}$, more than ${n-rank(A)}$ constraints ${x_i \geq 0}$ are active, namely all ${n-rank(A)}$ non-basic variables are zero and at least one of the basic variables is zero.
