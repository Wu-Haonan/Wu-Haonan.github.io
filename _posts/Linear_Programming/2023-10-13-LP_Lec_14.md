This blog is talking about how to move to another basic feasible solution and how to judge the basic feasible solution is optimal.

# Feasible direction

<b>Def 3.1</b> Let $\bar{x}$ be an element of a polyhedron $P$ inside $\mathbb{R}^n$. A vector $d \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is said to be a <b>feasible direction</b> at $\bar{x}$ if there exists a positive scalar $\theta$ for which $\bar{x} + \theta \bar{d} \in P$

<b>Basic feasible directions</b>: how to move along edges of the feasible polyhedron?

Let $\bar{x}$ be a basic feasible solution $B(1), ..., B(m)$ be the indices of the basic variables

<center>$$
B = \begin{bmatrix}
A_{B(1)} & A_{B(2)} & \dots & A_{B(m)}
\end{bmatrix}
$$</center>

be the corresponding basis matrix.

Recall that $x_i = 0$ for $i \not\in \\{B(1), ..., B(m)\\}$

<center>$$
\bar{x}_B = \begin{bmatrix}
x_{B(1)} \\
\vdots \\
x_{B(m)}
\end{bmatrix}
$$</center>

is given by

<center>$$
\bar{x}_B = B^{-1} \bar{b}
$$</center>

We want to move from $\bar{x}$ to $\bar{x} + \theta \bar{d}$ (with $\theta > 0$) in such a way that only one of the nonbasic variables, say $x_j$, increases.

This way, only one of the nonnegativity constraints active at the b.f.s. $\bar{x}$ is relaxed and no longer active at $\bar{x} + \theta \bar{d}$. This ensures that we travel along an edge of the feasible polyhedron.

Thus we choose $j \notin \\{B(1), B(2), ..., B(m)\\}$, and we set

$$
\begin{cases} 
d_j = 1 \\
d_i = 0, & \text{for all } i \notin \{B(1), B(2), ..., B(m)\} \text{ with } i \neq j
\end{cases}
$$

Since we want to move within the feasible region, we require that the equality constraints are still satisfied as we move, i.e., we require $A(\mathbf{x} + \theta \mathbf{d}) = \mathbf{b}$.

<center>$$
\begin{aligned}
&A(\bar{x} + \theta \bar{d}) = \bar{b},
A\bar{x} = \bar{b} \\
& \Rightarrow
\theta \cdot A\bar{d} = \bar{0},
\theta > 0 \\
&\Rightarrow  A\bar{d} = \bar{0}.
\end{aligned}
$$</center>

Hence

$$
\bar{0} = A\bar{d} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \bar{A}_i d_i = \bar{A}_j \cdot \textbf{1} + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \bar{A}_{B(i)} d_{B(i)} = \bar{A}_j + B \cdot \bar{d}_B
$$

Since the basis matrix $B$ is invertible, we obtain

$$
\bar{A}_j + B \bar{d}_B = \bar{0}
$$

$$
B \bar{d}_B = - \bar{A}_j
$$

$$
\bar{d}_B = - B^{-1} \bar{A}_j
$$

The vector $\bar{d} = \begin{bmatrix} \bar{d}_B \\ \bar{d}_N \end{bmatrix}$ with $\bar{d}_N = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ \vdots \\ 1 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$ (only ${ j^{\text{th}} }$ component as ${ 1 }$) and $\bar{d}_B = -B^{-1} \bar{A}_j$ (basic components) is called <b>$j^{th}$ basic direction</b> at the b.f.s. $\bar{x}$ with basis matrix $B$.
