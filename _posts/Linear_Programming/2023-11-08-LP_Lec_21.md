In this blog, we will show the power of LP problem and duality in mathematics. In this series of blog, we focus on the method that how to solve LP problem. But a "good" math can interacts to other branches of math. We gonna show how LP can be a tool to prove Farkas' Lemma, which is the base of Convex Optimization.
