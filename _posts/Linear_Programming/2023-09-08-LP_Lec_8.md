# Polyhedra and Convex Set

## Polyhedra

<b>Definition</b>: A <b><font color=red>polyhedron</font></b> is a subset of ${ \mathbb{R}^n }$ of the form ${ \\{\bar{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \| A \bar{x} \geq \bar{b} \\} }$

Where ${ A }$ is a ${ m \times n }$ matrix and ${ \bar{b} }$ is a vector in ${ \mathbb{R}^m }$

<b>Definition</b>: A subset of ${ \mathbb{R}^n }$ of the form ${ \\{\bar{x}\in \mathbb{R}^n \| A\bar{x} = \bar{b}, \bar{x} \geq \bar{0}\\} }$ is called a <b><font color=red>polyhedron in standard form representation</font></b>. 

Note: A polyhedron can either "<b>extend to infinity</b>" or be confined in a <b>finite region</b>! 

<b>Definition</b>: A subset ${ S }$ is  <b><font color=red>bounded</font></b> if ${ \exists K >0 }$ such that the absolute value of every component of every element of ${ S }$ is less than or equal to ${ K }$. 

In other word, A subset ${ S }$ is <b><font color=red>bounded</font></b> if ${ \exists K >0 }$ such that

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
S \subset \left\{ 
\left[\begin{matrix}
x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots  \\ x_n
\end{matrix}\right] \in \mathbb{R}^n \middle|
\begin{aligned}
\vert x_1 \vert &\leq K \\
\vert x_2 \vert &\leq K \\
& \vdots \\
\vert x_n \vert &\leq K
\end{aligned}
\right\}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

## Affine subspace and level set in high dimension

Let's generalize the level set from ${ 2 }$ to ${ n }$ dimension sapce. 

Let's ${ \bar{a} }$ be a non-zero vector in ${ \mathbb{R}^n }$. The set ${ \{\bar{x}\in \mathbb{R} \| \bar{a}^\top  =0 \} }$ is the set of all vectors ${ \bar{x} }$ in ${ \mathbb{R}^n }$ that are orthogonal to the nonzero vector ${  \bar{a}^\top }$. It's an ${ (n-1) }$-dimensional linear subspace of ${ \mathbb{R}^n }$.

More generally, the set ${ \\{\bar{x}\in \mathbb{R}^n \| \bar{a}^\top \bar{x} = b\\} }$ is the set of all points ${ \bar{x} }$ in ${  \mathbb{R}^n}$ statisfying ${ \bar{a}^\top \bar{x} = b }$, we have 

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\Vert \bar{a} \Vert \cdot \Vert \bar{x} \Vert \cdot \cos \theta &= b \\
\Vert \bar{x} \Vert \cdot \cos \theta &= \frac{b}{\Vert \bar{a} \Vert}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

Here, ${ \theta }$ is the angle between ${ \bar{a}}$ and ${ \bar{x} }$.

It is the ${ (n-1) }$-dimension <b><font color=red>affine subspace</font></b> of ${ \mathbb{R}^n }$ comprised of all points ${ \bar{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n }$ whose orthogonal projection on the line spaned by the nonzero vector ${ \bar{a} }$ is located at (signed) distance ${ \frac{b}{\Vert \bar{a} \Vert} }$ from the origin in the direction of the vector ${ \bar{a} }$.

In other word, ${ \\{\bar{x}\in \mathbb{R}^n \| \bar{a}^\top \bar{x} = b\\} }$ is the <b>hyperplane</b> orthogonal to the line ${ span\{\bar{a}\} }$ and intersecting that line at the point ${ \frac{b}{\Vert \bar{a} \Vert} \cdot \frac{\bar{a}}{\Vert \bar{a} \Vert} }$ (${ \frac{b}{\Vert \bar{a} \Vert} }$ is rescaling factor, ${ \frac{\bar{a}}{\Vert \bar{a} \Vert} }$ is the unit vector represent direction)

The set ${ \\{\bar{x}\in \mathbb{R}^n \| \bar{a}^\top \bar{x} \geq b\\} }$ is the <b>hyperspace</b> of ${ \mathbb{R}^n }$ whose boundary is the hyperplane ${ \\{\bar{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \| \bar{a}^\top \bar{x} = b\\} }$

Note: <b><font color=red>a polyhedron ${ \{\bar{x}\in \mathbb{R}^n | A \bar{x} \geq \bar{b}\} }$ is the intersection of a finite number of halfspaces. </font></b>

## Convex set

<b>Definition</b>: A subset ${ S }$ of ${ \mathbb{R}^n }$ is said to be <b><font color=red>convex</font></b> if the segment of line joining any two elements ${ \bar{p} }$ and ${\bar{q}  }$ of ${ S }$ is fully contained in the set ${ S }$.

We can rephase the definition as follow

<b>Definition</b>: A subset ${ S \subset \mathbb{R}^n }$ is said to be <b><font color=red>convex</font></b> if ${ \forall \bar{p},\bar{q} \in S }$ and ${ \forall \lambda \in [0,1] }$, we have ${ (1-\lambda)\bar{p} + \lambda \bar{q} \in S}$.

## Convex Combination and Convex hull

<b>Definition</b>: Let ${ \bar{p_1}, \bar{p_2} ,\cdots, \bar{p_k}}$ be ${ k }$ vectors in ${ \mathbb{R}^n }$

* We say that a vector ${ \bar{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n }$ is a <b><font color=red>convex combination</font></b> of the vectors ${ \bar{p_1}, \bar{p_2} ,\cdots, \bar{p_k}}$ if ${ \bar{v} }$ can be written as ${ \bar{v} = \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i \bar{p_i} }$, where ${ \lambda_1,\lambda_2, \cdots, \lambda_k  }$ are ${ k }$ nonnegative scalars such that ${ \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 +  \cdots+ \lambda_k =1 }$

* <b><font color=red>Convex hull</font></b> of the vectors ${ \bar{p_1}, \bar{p_2} ,\cdots, \bar{p_k}}$ is the set of all convex combination of these ${ k}$ vectors. 

<b>* What the convex hull look like?</b>

For two points ${ \bar{p_1}, \bar{p_2}}$, it's the set ${ \{(1-\lambda)\bar{p_1}+ \lambda \bar{p_2} \in \mathbb{R}^n \| \forall \lambda \in [0,1]\} }$. It's easy to get the convex hull the segment of line joining two points.

How about three points?

Pick up one vector from convex hull of ${ \bar{p_1}, \bar{p_2}, \bar{p_3} }$ We have ${\bar{v} = \lambda_1 \bar{p_1} +\lambda_2 \bar,{p_2} +\lambda_2 \bar{p_2} }$, and ${ \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 =1 ,  \lambda_1,\lambda_2, \lambda_3 \geq 0}$, that is 

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\bar{v} &= \lambda_1 \bar{p_1} +\lambda_2 \bar,{p_2} +\lambda_2 \bar{p_2} \\
& = (1-\lambda_3) \left(\frac{\lambda_1}{1-\lambda_3} \bar{p_1} + \frac{\lambda_2}{1-\lambda_3} \bar{p_2} \right) + \lambda_3 \bar{p_3} \\
& = = (1-\lambda_3) \left(\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2} \bar{p_1} + \frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2} \bar{p_2} \right) + \lambda_3 \bar{p_3}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

That means, first we have the segment of line joining two points ${ \bar{p_1}, \bar{p_2}}$ (convex hull of ${ \bar{p_1}, \bar{p_2}}$), and pick up each point ${ \bar{q} }$ from this segment to generate the new segment joining two points ${  \bar{q}  \bar{p_3}}$. Then we can have a triangle with points ${ \bar{p_1}, \bar{p_2}, \bar{p_3} }$ as corner.

If we have more dimension, we can generate from segment to triangle to pyramid (base as triangle).

## Theorems

(a) **The intersection of convex sets is also convex set.**

Proof. Suppose $S_1,S_2$ are convex sets. Then, $\forall \bar{x},\bar{y} \in S_1 \cap S_2$ and $\forall \lambda \in [0,1]$, we have $(1-\lambda)\bar{x} + \lambda \bar{y} \in S_1$ and  $(1-\lambda)\bar{x} + \lambda \bar{y} \in S_2$. Hence,  $(1-\lambda)\bar{x} + \lambda \bar{y} \in S_1 \cap S_2$. So $S_1\cap S_2$ is also a convex set. $\square$



(b) **Every polyhedron is a convex set.**

Proof. Suppose polyhedron $P = \{\bar{x} \in \mathbb{R} \mid A\bar{x} \geq \bar{b}\}$. $\forall \bar{p},\bar{q} \in P$, we have $A\bar{p} \geq \bar{b}, A\bar{q} \geq \bar{b}$. Then $\forall \lambda \in [0,1]$, we have $A((1-\lambda)\bar{p} + \lambda \bar{q}) = (1-\lambda)A\bar{p} + \lambda A \bar{q} \geq (1-\lambda)\bar{b} + \lambda \bar{b} = \bar{b} $. $\square$



(c) **A convex combination of a finite number of elements of a convex set also belongs to that set.** Proof. Suppose $S$ is a convex set and $\bar{p}_1,\bar{p}_2,\cdots,\bar{p}_n \in S$, and $\lambda_1,\cdots,\lambda_n \geq 0$ such that $\lambda_1 + \cdots + \lambda_n = 1$. We will show $\bar{v} = \sum_{i =1}^n \lambda_i \bar{p}_i \in S$ by induction.

Base case: $n = 1$, $\lambda_1 = 1$. It's trivial to get $\bar{p}_1 \in S$.

Induction Hypothesis $\sum_{i =1}^{n-1} \lambda_i \bar{p}_i \in S$.

Then, we have $\sum_{i =1}^{n} \lambda_i \bar{p}_i = \lambda_n \bar{p}_n + (1-\lambda_n) \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{\lambda_i}{1-\lambda_n} \bar{p}_i $. We know $\lambda_1 + \cdots + \lambda_n = 1$ that means $\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{\lambda_i}{1-\lambda_n} = 1$. By induction hypothesis, $\bar{x} = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{\lambda_i}{1-\lambda_n} \bar{p}_i \in S$. Then, we know $\sum_{i =1}^{n} \lambda_i \bar{p}_i =\lambda_n \bar{p}_n + (1-\lambda_n) \bar{x} \in S $. $\square$



(d) **The convex hull of a finite number of vectors is a convex set.**

Proof. Denote the convex hull $H$ is generated by vector $\bar{p}_1,\bar{p}_2,\cdots,\bar{p}_n$. $\forall \bar{x},\bar{y} \in H$, there exists a set of nonnegative coefficients for each one, such that $\sum \alpha_i = \sum \beta_i =1$ and $\bar{x} = \sum \alpha_i \bar{p}_i, \bar{y} = \sum \beta_i \bar{p}_i$. Then, $\forall \lambda \in [0,1]$, we have 

$$
\begin{aligned}
(1-\lambda) \bar{x} + \lambda \bar{y} &= \sum ((1-\lambda)\alpha_i + \lambda \beta_i) \bar{p}_i
\end{aligned}
$$

And, we know $\sum (1-\lambda)\alpha_i + \lambda \beta_i = (1-\lambda) \sum \alpha_i + \lambda \sum  \beta_i = 1$. So $(1-\lambda) \bar{x} + \lambda \bar{y} \in H$. That means $H$ is a convex set. $\square$
