This blog is talking about how to solve the basic solutions from LO problem.

# Rank (Remove redundant constraints)

Recall: A polyhedron of the form ${ P = \\{\bar{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \| A' \bar{x} = \bar{b'}, \bar{x} \geq \bar{0} \\} }$ where ${ A' }$ is an ${ m\times n }$ matrix ${ \bar{b'} \in \mathbb{R}^m }$ is said to be a <b>polyhedron in standard form</b>.

If the rank of matrix ${ A' }$ is ${ k }$, we can extract ${ k }$ linearly independent rows from ${ A' }$ and the corresponding elements from ${ b }$. (Here, we need to note we have to guarantee ${ A' \bar{x} = \bar{b'} }$ have solutions, or say ${ P }$ is not empty.) Hence, we get ${ A  \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times n}, \bar{b} \in \mathbb{R}^k }$.

<b>Theorem</b>: Provide ${ P }$ is nonempty, the polyhedra

<center>$$
P = \{\bar{x}\in \mathbb{R}^n | A' \bar{x} = \bar{b'}, \bar{x} \geq \bar{0}\}
$$</center>

and 

<center>$$
Q = \{\bar{x}\in \mathbb{R}^n | A \bar{x} = \bar{b}, \bar{x} \geq \bar{0}\}
$$</center>

coincide. (i.e. ${ P = Q }$)

Proof. LO_2.3

The above talking can let us describe constraints more ecomically as ${ A \bar{x} = \bar{b} , \bar{x} \geq \bar{0}}$, where ${ A }$ has full (row) rank. 

# How to solve basic solution

Now, suppose ${ A }$ is full rank, how can we solve the basic solution in standard form.

## Theorem

<b>Theorem</b>: Assuming the ${ m }$ rows of the matrix ${ A  \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n} }$ are linearly independent, consider the constraints ${ A \bar{x} = \bar{b} }$ and ${ \bar{x} \geq \bar{0} }$.

A vector ${ \bar{x}^\* \in \mathbb{R}^n }$ is a basic solution <b>if and only if</b> ${ A \bar{x}^\* = \bar{b}}$ is satisfied and there exists indices ${ B(1),B(2),\cdots,B(m) }$ such that 

(1) the columns ${ \overline{A}\_{B(1)},\overline{A}\_{B(2)},\cdots, \overline{A}\_{B(m)} }$ are linearlu independent and

(2) ${ x^*_i = 0 }$ if ${ i \notin \\{B(1),B(2),\cdots,B(m)\\} }$

Proof. LO_2.3

## Recipe for solving basic solutions

By above theorem, we can give the recipe to find the basic solutions of a standard form polyhedron

Assuming the ${ m }$ rows of the matrix ${ A  \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n} }$ are linearly independent, the polyhedron is in standard form  ${A \bar{x} = \bar{b} }$ and ${ \bar{x} \geq \bar{0} }$. 

STEP 1: Choose ${ m }$ linearly independent columns ${ \overline{A}\_{B(1)},\overline{A}\_{B(2)},\cdots, \overline{A}\_{B(m)} }$ in matrix ${ A }$.

STEP 2: Let ${ x^*_i = 0, \forall i \notin \\{B(1),B(2),\cdots,B(m)\\} }$

STEP 3: Solve the system ${ A \bar{x}^\* = \bar{b} }$. (In fact we only need to solve ${ B \bar{x_B}^\* = \bar{b} }$, here ${ B }$ comprised by columns ${ \overline{A}\_{B(1)},\overline{A}\_{B(2)},\cdots, \overline{A}\_{B(m)} }$, and ${ \bar{x}^*_B }$ only contains the elements with indices ${ B(1),B(2),\cdots,B(m) }$)

STEP 4: If all components of the basic solution ${ \bar{x}^* }$ obtained by STEP 3 are nonnegative, then this basic solution is a <b>basic feasible solution</b>.
