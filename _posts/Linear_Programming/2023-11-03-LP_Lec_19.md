In the end of the series of LP blogs, we will introduce a very important structure in LP problem, that is the dual problem. Dual problem can give us another view of a LP problem. There are a lot of applications of Duality in algorithm, like Max flow and Min Cut problem. Additionally, you can find more application of primal-dual techniques in my another [blog series](https://wu-haonan.github.io/2023/09/27/ADA_Lec_11.html).   



In this blog, we will first introduce what is dual problem, how to convert the primal problem to its dual problem.
