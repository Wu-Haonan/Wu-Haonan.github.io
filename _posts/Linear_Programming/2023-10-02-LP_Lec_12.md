This blog is talking about the <b>when</b> there exists <b>extreme points</b>. The key idea of solving LP problem is optimal solution will be at basic feasible solution. But, some polyhedron have no extreme point. This blog will introduce how to tell a polyhedron pocesses at least one extreme point.

<b>Definition</b>: A polyhedron ${ P \subset \mathbb{R}^n }$ <b>contains a line</b>
if there exists a vector ${ \bar{x} \in P }$
and a nonzero vector ${ \bar{d} \in \mathbb{R}^n }$
such that ${ \bar{x} + \lambda \bar{d} \in P }$ for all scalars ${ \lambda \in \mathbb{R} }$.

<b>Theorem</b>: For a nonempty polyhedron ${ P = \{ \bar{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \bar{a}^\top \bar{x} \geq \bar{b}, i=1,2,\cdots,m \} }$, the following assertions are equivalent:

1. ${ P }$ has at least one extreme point.

2. ${ P }$ contains no line.

3. ${ \text{span} \{ \bar{a}_1, \bar{a}_2, \cdots, \bar{a}_m \} = \mathbb{R}^n }$

Proof.

<b>Corollary</b>: 

(1) Every nonempty bounded polyhedron has at least one basic feasible solution / extreme point.

(2) Every nonempty bounded polyhedron in standard form has at least one basic feasible solution / extreme point. (Because polyhedron in standard form contains no line.)
