This blog is talking about three different characterizations of the corners of a polyhedron, say ${ P }$, and then show that all three characterizations are equivalent.

# Extreme Points

<b>Definition</b>: An <b><font color=red>extreme point</font></b> of a polyhedron ${ P }$ is a vector ${ \bar{x} \in P }$ such that one cannot find two vectors ${ \bar{y}, \bar{z} \in P }$ both different from ${ 
\bar{x} }$ and a scalar ${ \lambda \in [0,1] }$ such that ${ \bar{x} = (1-\lambda)\bar{y} + \lambda \bar{z} }$.

# Vertices

<b>Definition</b>: A vector ${ \bar{x} \in P }$ is a <b><font color=red>vertex</font></b> of the polyhedron ${ P }$ if there exists some vector ${ \bar{c} }$ such that ${ \bar{c}^ \top \bar{x} < \bar{c}^\top \bar{y} }$ for all ${ \bar{y} \in P, \bar{y} \neq \bar{x} }$

From ${ \bar{c}^ \top \bar{x} < \bar{c}^\top \bar{y} }$, we have ${ \bar{c}^\top (\bar{y} - \bar{x}) > 0 }$. That means the angle between the vectors ${ \bar{c} }$ and  ${ \bar{y} - \bar{x}  }$ is less than ${ 90 ^\circ }$, for all ${ \bar{y} \in P, \bar{y} \neq \bar{x} }$.

<b>Hence, the polyhedron is fully containd in a halfspace of ${ \mathbb{R}^n }$. And the halfspace takes halfplane ${ \\{\bar{y}\in \mathbb{R}^n \| \bar{c}^\top \bar{y} = \bar{c}^\top \bar{x}\\} }$ as boundary and ${ \bar{x} }$ is the only point of ${ P }$ belonging to that hyperplane.</b>

In other words, ${ \bar{x} }$ is a vertex of ${  P}$ if and only if ${ P }$ is on one side of a hyperplane which meets ${ P }$ only at the point ${ \bar{x} }$

# Basic Feasible Solution

## Active constraints

Consider a polyhedron ${ P \in \mathbb{R}^n }$ defined by a family of linear equality and inequality constraints:

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\bar{a_i}^\top \bar{x} &\leq b_i, &i \in L \\
\bar{a_j}^\top \bar{x} &= b_j, &j \in E \\
\bar{a_k}^\top \bar{x} &\geq b_k, &k \in G
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$</center>
<b>Definition</b>: If a vector ${ \bar{x}^* }$ statisfies ${ \bar{a_i}^\top \bar{x}^* = b_i }$ for some ${ i \in L, E }$ or ${ G }$, we say that corresponding constraint is <b><font color=red>active</font></b> or binding at ${ \bar{x}^* }$.

<b>* When do the constraints active at a point charaterize that point uniquely?</b>

<b>Theorem</b>: Fix a point ${ \bar{x}^* \in \mathbb{R}^n }$ and consider

* the set ${ I_{\bar{x}^\*} = \\{i \in L \cup E \cup G\| \bar{a_i}^\top \bar{x}^\* = b_i\\}}$ of indices of constraints that are active at ${ \bar{x}^* }$

* and the set ${ \\{ \bar{a_i} \in \mathbb{R}^n \| i \in I_{\bar{x}^\*} \\} }$ of normal vector to the hyperplanes corresponding to constraints active at ${ \bar{x}^\* }$

Then following are equivalent:

(1) There exists ${ n }$ linearly independent vectors in the set ${ \\{ \bar{a_i} \in \mathbb{R}^n \| i \in I_{\bar{x}^*} \\} }$

(2) Every element of ${ \mathbb{R}^n }$ can be represented as a linear combination of ${ \\{ \bar{a_i} \in \mathbb{R}^n \| i \in I_{\bar{x}^\*} \\} }$. In other words, ${\text{span} \\{ \bar{a_i} \in \mathbb{R}^n \| i \in I_{\bar{x}^\*} \\} = \mathbb{R}^n}$

(3) The system of linear equations

$$
\bar{a_i}^\top \bar{x} = b_i, \quad \text{for } i \in I_{\bar{x}^*}
$$

has a unique solution ${  \bar{x}^*}$.

Proof. 

* (2) $\Rightarrow$ (1)

Suppose ${\text{span}\\{\bar{a}\_i \mid i \in I\_{x^\*}\\} = \mathbb{R}^n}$. Then, one can extract a basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$ from the set ${\\{\bar{a}\_i \mid i \in I\_{x^\*}\\}}$. The ${n}$ vectors that are constituting basis are necessarily linearly independent (by the definition of basis.)

* (1) $\Rightarrow$ (2)

Suppose $\bar{a}\_{i_1}, \bar{a}\_{i_2}, ..., \bar{a}\_{i_n}$ are ${n}$ linearly independent vectors in the set ${\\{\bar{a}\_i \mid i \in I\_{x^\*}\\}}$. Then ${\text{span}\\{\bar{a}\_{i_1}, \bar{a}\_{i_2}, ..., \bar{a}\_{i_n}\\}}$ is an $n$-dimensional linear subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Thus

$$
\text{span}\{\bar{a}_{i_1}, \bar{a}_{i_2}, ..., \bar{a}_{i_n}\} = \mathbb{R}^n
$$

However, ${\\{\bar{a}\_{i_1}, \bar{a}\_{i_2}, ..., \bar{a}\_{i_n}\\} \subset \\{\bar{a}_i \mid i \in I\_{x^\*}\\} \subset \mathbb{R}^n}$, which implies

$$
\text{span}\{\bar{a}_{i_1}, \bar{a}_{i_2}, ..., \bar{a}_{i_n}\} \subset \text{span}\{\bar{a}_i | i \in I^{n*}\} \subset \mathbb{R}^n
$$

It follows that ${\text{span}\\{\bar{a}_i \mid i \in I^{n*}\\} = \mathbb{R}^n}$.

* (2) $\Rightarrow$ (3)

Suppose the system $\bar{a}\_i^{\top} x = b_i$ for $i \in I\_{x\*}$ has **multiple** solutions, say $x_1$ and $x_2$, 
then the (nonzero) vector $\bar{d} = x_2 - x_1$ satisfies $\bar{a}\_i^{\top} \bar{d} = 0$ for all $i \in I\_{x^\*}$. But then $\bar{d}$ (being orthogonal to every vector $\bar{a}_i$ with $i \in I\_{x^\*}$) and the vector $\bar{d}$ is not a linear combination of those vectors, which contradicts that vectors $\bar{a}_i$ with $i \in I\_{x^\*}$ do not span $\mathbb{R}^n$.

* (3) $\Rightarrow$ (2) 

Suppose the vectors $\bar{a}\_i$ with $i \in I\_{x^\*}$ **do not** span $\mathbb{R}^n$,  we can choose a nonzero vector ${\bar{d} \in (\text{span}\\{\bar{a}\_i \mid i \in I\_{x^\*}\\})^\perp}$. Then, we have $\bar{a}\_i^{\top} x^\* = b_i,\forall i \in I\_{x^\*}$ and ${\bar{d} \in (\text{span}\\{\bar{a}\_i \mid i \in I\_{x^\*}\\})^\perp \iff \bar{a}\_i^{\top} \bar{d} = 0,\forall i \in I\_{x^\*}}$.

Therefore, $\bar{a}\_i^{\top}(x^* + t\bar{d}) = b_i, \forall i \in I\_{x^\*}$ (the parameter $t$ can be any real number we want).

Thus, the linear system $\bar{a}\_i^{\top} x = b_i$ for all $i \in I\_{x^*}$ admits infinitely many solutions, which contradicts to that $x^\*$ is the only solution of the system $\bar{a}\_i^{\top} x = b_i$ for all $i \in I\_{x^\*}$. $\square$

## Basic feasible solution

<b>Definition</b>: Consider a family of linear equality and inequality constraints describing a polyhedron ${ P\in \mathbb{R}^n }$

(1) A vector ${ \bar{x}^* \in \mathbb{R}^n }$ is said to be a <b><font color=red>basic solution</font></b> if all equality constraints  are active at ${ \bar{x}^* }$ and if there are ${ n }$ of the active constraints that are linearly independent.

(2) A basic solution that satisfies all constraints is called a <b><font color=red>basic feasible solution</font></b>

# Equivalence of Three Characterizations

<b>Theorem</b>: Let ${ \bar{x}^* }$ be a point in a non-empty polyhedron ${ P }$. Then following are equivalent

(1) ${ \bar{x}^* }$ is a <b>vertex</b> of ${ P }$

(2) ${ \bar{x}^* }$ is an <b>extreme point</b> of ${ P }$

(3) ${ \bar{x}^* }$ is a <b>basic feasible solution</b> of ${ P }$

**Proof.** Without loss of generality, we may assume that $P$ is represented by constraints of the form $\bar{a}_i^{\top} x \geq b_i$ and $\bar{a}_i^{\top} x = b_i$ exclusively.

* (1) $\Rightarrow$ (2)

Suppose $x^\*$ is a vertex of $P$. Then, by definition, $\exists \bar{c} \in \mathbb{R}^n, \bar{c} \neq \bar{0}$ such that 

$$
\forall \bar{y} \in P, \bar{y} \neq \bar{x}^* \Rightarrow \bar{c}^{\top} \bar{x}^* < \bar{c}^{\top}y.
$$


Pick any two $\bar{y}, \bar{z} \in P$ with $\bar{y} \neq \bar{x}^\*$ and $\bar{z} \neq \bar{x}^\*$and any scalar $\lambda \in [0,1]$. We necessarily have 

$$
\bar{c}^{\top} \bar{x}^* < \bar{c}^{\top}\bar{y} \quad \text{and} \quad \bar{c}^{\top} \bar{x}^* < \bar{c}^{\top}\bar{z}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\bar{c}^{\top}(\bar{y} - \bar{x}^*) &> 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \bar{c}^{\top}(\bar{z} - \bar{x}^*) > 0
\end{aligned}
$$

$\forall \lambda \in [0,1]$, we have

$$
(1-\lambda) \bar{c}^{\top}(\bar{y}-\bar{x}^*) + \lambda \bar{c}^{\top}(\bar{z}-\bar{x}^*) > 0
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
(1-\lambda) \bar{c}^{\top}\bar{y} + \lambda \bar{c}^{\top}\bar{z} > & (1-\lambda) \bar{c}^{\top} \bar{x}^* + \lambda \bar{c}^{\top} \bar{x}^* \\
\\
\bar{c}^{\top} \bar{x}^* < & \bar{c}^{\top}((1-\lambda)\bar{y} + \lambda \bar{z})
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore

$$
\bar{x}^* \neq (1-\lambda)\bar{y} + \lambda \bar{z}
$$

Thus $\bar{x}^\*$ cannot be expressed as a convex combination of two any other elements $\bar{y}, \bar{z}$ of $P$, which means $\bar{x}^\*$ extreme point of $P$.

* (2) $\Rightarrow$ (3)

Suppose $\bar{x}^\* \in P$ is **not** a basic feasible solution. Let ${I\_{\bar{x}^\*} = \\{ i \mid \bar{a}\_i^{\top} \bar{x}^\* = b_i \\}}$ be the set of indices of constraints that are active at $\bar{x}^\*$.



Since $\bar{x}^*$ is not a basic feasible solution, there do not exist $n$ linearly independent vectors in ${\\{ \bar{a}\_i \mid i \in I\_{\bar{x}^\*} \\}}$. Hence ${\text{span} \\{ \bar{a}_i \mid i \in I\_{\bar{x}^\*} \\}}$ is a proper subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and the dimension of ${(\text{span} \\{ \bar{a}_i \mid i \in I\_{\bar{x}^\*} \\})^\perp}\geq 1$, and we can pick a nonzero vector ${\bar{d} \in (\text{span} \\{ \bar{a}_i \mid i \in I\_{\bar{x}^\*} \\})^\perp}$.



In other words, there exists $\bar{d} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\bar{a}_i^{\top} \bar{d} = 0, \forall i \in I\_{x^\*}$. Consider the points of the form $\bar{x}^* + \epsilon \bar{d}$ where $\epsilon$ is a small positive number.



For all $i \in I_{\bar{x}^*}$, we have 

$$
\bar{a}_i^{\top}(\bar{x}^* + \epsilon \bar{d}) = \bar{a}_i^{\top} \bar{x}^* + \epsilon \bar{a}_i^{\top} \bar{d} = b_i + \epsilon \cdot 0 = b_i
$$

The constraints that are active at $\bar{x}^\*$ are also active at $\bar{x}^\* + \epsilon \bar{d}$. Furthermore, for $i \notin I_{\bar{x}^\*}$, we have 

$$
\bar{a}_i^{\top}(x^* \pm \epsilon \bar{d}) = (\bar{a}_i^{\top} \bar{x}^*) \pm \epsilon (\bar{a}_i^{\top} \bar{d})
$$

Here, we know $\bar{a}\_i \bar{x}^\* \geq b_i$ (because $\bar{x}^\*$ is a feasible solution, $\bar{x}^\* \in P$) and $\bar{a}_i \bar{x}^\* \neq b_i$ (because $\bar{x^\*}$ is not active at this constraint, $i \notin I\_{\bar{x}^\*}$), which implies $\bar{a}\_i \bar{x}^\* > b\_i$. Therefore, by choosing $\epsilon$ sufficiently small (such that $\epsilon \vert \bar{a}\_i^{\top} \bar{d} \vert < \bar{a}\_i \bar{x}^\* - b\_i$). 



In other word, we construct two points $\bar{y}:=\bar{x}^\* + \epsilon \bar{d}$ and $\bar{z}:= \bar{x}^\* - \epsilon \bar{d}$ both belong to $P$. Since $\bar{x}^\* = \frac{1}{2} \bar{y} + \frac{1}{2} \bar{z}$, which contradicts to that $\bar{x}^\*$ is an extreme points of $P$.

* (3) $\Rightarrow$ (1)

Suppose $\bar{x}^\*$ is a basic feasible solution of $P$ and let ${I\_{\bar{x}^\*} = \\{ i \mid \bar{a}\_i^{\top} \bar{x}^\* = b\_i \\}}$ be the set of indices of constraints that are active at $\bar{x}^\*$. Consider the vector $\bar{c} = \sum\_{i \in I_{\bar{x}^\*}} \bar{a}_i$. We have 

$$
\bar{c}^{\top} \bar{x}^* = \sum_{i \in I_{\bar{x}^*}} \bar{a}_i^{\top} \bar{x}^* = \sum_{i \in I_{\bar{x}^*}} b_i
$$

Furthermore, for any element $x \in P$, we have $\bar{a}_i^{\top} x \geq b_i, \forall i \in I_{\bar{x}^*}$ and thus 

$$
\bar{c}^{\top} \bar{x} = \sum_{i \in I_{\bar{x}^*}} \bar{a}_i^{\top} \bar{x} \geq \sum_{i \in I_{\bar{x}^*}} b_i \quad \quad \quad (*)
$$

This shows that $x^*$ is an optimal solution to the problem of minimizing the function $x \mapsto \bar{c}^{\top} x$ over the polyhedron $P$.

Equality holds in $(\ast)$ **if and only if** $\bar{a}\_i^{\top} \bar{x} = b\_i, \forall i \in I\_{\bar{x}^\*}$. However, since $\bar{x}^\*$ is a basic feasible solution, there are $n$ linearly independent constraints that are active at $\bar{x}^\*$ and $\bar{x}^\*$ is therefore the unique solution of the linear system $\bar{a}\_i^{\top} \bar{x} = b\_i, i \in I\_{\bar{x}^\*}$ according to above [theorem](https://wu-haonan.github.io/2023/09/11/LP_Lec_9.html#active-constraints). $\square$
