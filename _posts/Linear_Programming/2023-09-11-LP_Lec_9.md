This blog is talking about three different characterizations of the corners of a polyhedron, say ${ P }$, and then show that all three charactarizations are equivalent.

# Extreme Points

<b>Definition</b>: An <b><font color=red>extreme point</font></b> of a polyhedron ${ P }$ is a vector ${ \bar{x} \in P }$ such that one cannot find two vectors ${ \bar{y}, \bar{z} \in P }$ both different from ${ 
\bar{x} }$ and a scalar ${ \lambda \in [0,1] }$ such that ${ \bar{x} = (1-\lambda)\bar{y} + \lambda \bar{z} }$.

# Vertices

<b>Definition</b>: A vector ${ \bar{x} \in P }$ is a <b><font color=red>vertex</font></b> of the polyhedron ${ P }$ if there exists some vector ${ \bar{c} }$ such that ${ \bar{c}^ \top \bar{x} < \bar{c}^\top \bar{y} }$ for all ${ \bar{y} \in P, \bar{y} \neq \bar{x} }$

From ${ \bar{c}^ \top \bar{x} < \bar{c}^\top \bar{y} }$, we have ${ \bar{c}^\top (\bar{y} - \bar{x}) > 0 }$. That means the angle between the vectors ${ \bar{c} }$ and  ${ \bar{y} - \bar{x}  }$ is less than ${ 90 ^\circ }$, for all ${ \bar{y} \in P, \bar{y} \neq \bar{x} }$.

<b>Hence, the polyhedron is fully containd in a halfspace of ${ \mathbb{R}^n }$. And the halfspace takes halfplane ${ \\{\bar{y}\in \mathbb{R}^n \| \bar{c}^\top \bar{y} = \bar{c}^\top \bar{x}\\} }$ as boundary and ${ \bar{x} }$ is the only point of ${ P }$ belonging to that hyperplane.</b>

In other words, ${ \bar{x} }$ is a vertex of ${  P}$ if and only if ${ P }$ is on one side of a hyperplane which meets ${ P }$ only at the point ${ \bar{x} }$

# Basic Feasible Solution

## Active constraints

Consider a polyhedron ${ P \in \mathbb{R}^n }$ defined by a family of linear equality and inequality constraints:

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\bar{a_i}^\top \bar{x} &\leq b_i, &i \in L \\
\bar{a_j}^\top \bar{x} &= b_j, &j \in E \\
\bar{a_k}^\top \bar{x} &\geq b_k, &k \in G
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

<b>Definition</b>: If a vector ${ \bar{x}^* }$ statisifies ${ \bar{a_i}^\top \bar{x}^* = b_i }$ for some ${ i \in L, E }$ or ${ G }$, we say that corresponding constraint is <b><font color=red>active</font></b> or binding at ${ \bar{x}^* }$.

<b>* When do the constraints active at a point charaterize that point uniquely?</b>

<b>Theorem</b>: Fix a point ${ \bar{x}^* \in \mathbb{R}^n }$ and consider

* the set ${ I_{\bar{x}^\*} = \\{i \in L \cup E \cup G\| \bar{a_i}^\top \bar{x}^\* = b_i\\}}$

* and the set ${ \\{ \bar{a_i} \in \mathbb{R}^n \| i \in I_{\bar{x}^*} \\} }$ of normal vector to the hyperplanes corresponding to constraints active at ${ \bar{x}^* }$

Then following are equivalent:

(1) There exists ${ n }$ linearly independent vectors in the set ${ \\{ \bar{a_i} \in \mathbb{R}^n \| i \in I_{\bar{x}^*} \\} }$

(2) Every element of ${ \mathbb{R}^n }$ can be represented as a linear combination of ${ \\{ \bar{a_i} \in \mathbb{R}^n \| i \in I_{\bar{x}^*} \\} }$. In ohter words, ${ span \\{ \bar{a_i} \in \mathbb{R}^n \| i \in I_{\bar{x}^*} \\} = \mathbb{R}^n}$

(3) The system of linear equations

<center>$$
\bar{a_i}^\top \bar{x} = b_i, \quad \text{for } i \in I_{\bar{x}^*}
$$</center>

has a unique solution ${  \bar{x}^*}$.

## Basic feasible solution

<b>Definition</b>: Consider a family of linear equality and inequality constraints describing a polyhedron ${ P\in \mathbb{R}^n }$

(1) A vector ${ \bar{x}^* \in \mathbb{R}^n }$ is said to be a <b><font color=red>basic solution</font></b> if all equality constraints  are active at ${ \bar{x}^* }$ and if there are ${ n }$ of the active constraints that are linearly independent.

(2) A basic solution that satisfies all constraints is called a <b><font color=red>basic feasible solution</font></b>

# Equivalence of Three Charaterization

<b>Theorem</b>: Let ${ \bar{x}^* }$ be a point in a non-empty polyhedron ${ P }$. Then following are equivalent

(1) ${ \bar{x}^* }$ is a <b>vertex</b> of ${ P }$

(2) ${ \bar{x}^* }$ is an <b>extreme point</b> of ${ P }$

(3) ${ \bar{x}^* }$ is a <b>basic feasible solution</b> of ${ P }$
