This blog is talking about three different characterizations of the corners of a polyhedron, say ${ P }$, and then show that all three charactarizations are equivalent.

# Extreme Points

<b>Definition</b>: An <b><font color=red>extreme point</font></b> of a polyhedron ${ P }$ is a vector ${ \bar{x} \in P }$ such that one cannot find two vectors ${ \bar{y}, \bar{z} \in P }$ both different from ${ 
\bar{x} }$ and a scalar ${ \lambda \in [0,1] }$ such that ${ \bar{x} = (1-\lambda)\bar{y} + \lambda \bar{z} }$.

# Vertices

<b>Definition</b>: A vector ${ \bar{x} \in P }$ is a <b><font color=red>vertex</font></b> of the polyhedron ${ P }$ if there exists some vector ${ \bar{c} }$ such that ${ \bar{c}^ \top \bar{x} < \bar{c}^\top \bar{y} }$ for all ${ \bar{y} \in P, \bar{y} \neq \bar{x} }$

From ${ \bar{c}^ \top \bar{x} < \bar{c}^\top \bar{y} }$, we have ${ \bar{c}^\top (\bar{y} - \bar{x}) > 0 }$. That means the angle between the vectors ${ \bar{c} }$ and  ${ \bar{y} - \bar{x}  }$ is less than ${ 90 ^\circ }$, for all ${ \bar{y} \in P, \bar{y} \neq \bar{x} }$.

<b>Hence, the polyhedron is fully containd in a halfspace of ${ \mathbb{R}^n }$. And the halfspace takes halfplane ${ \\{\bar{y}\in \mathbb{R}^n \| \bar{c}^\top \bar{y} = \bar{c}^\top \bar{x}\\} }$ as boundary and ${ \bar{x} }$ is the only point of ${ P }$ belonging to that hyperplane.</b>

In other words, ${ \bar{x} }$ is a vertex of ${  P}$ if and only if ${ P }$ is on one side of a hyperplane which meets ${ P }$ only at the point ${ \bar{x} }$
