This blog is talking about how along we can move along basic feasible direction, i.e. ${ \theta }$ and talking abou the termination of Simplex Method.

Recall our assumptions: LP problem in standard form

<center>$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text{minimize} & \mathbf{c}^\top \mathbf{x} \\
& \text{subject to} & A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b} \\
& & \mathbf{x} \geq 0 \\
\end{aligned}
$$</center>

where matrix $A$ has full row rank.

We introduce an additional assumption (which will be relaxed later on):

> **Every b.f.s. is nondegenerate.**

Given a b.f.s. ${\bar{\mathbf{x}}}$ (with associated basis matrix $B$) of the feasible polyhedron $P = \{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n | A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b} \text{ and } \mathbf{x} \geq 0 \}$,

**EITHER**

all reduced costs ${\bar{c}_j}$ for all nonbasic variables are nonnegative, and ${\bar{\mathbf{x}}}$ is an optimal solution (according to Thm 2.1) and the simplex algorithm stops

**OR**

the reduced cost ${\bar{c}_j}$ of a nonbasic variable ${x_j}$ is negative, and the ${j^{th}}$ basic direction at ${\bar{\mathbf{x}}}$ is a feasible direction of cost decrease.

The vector ${\mathbf{d}_j}$ with

<center>$$
\mathbf{d}_j = \begin{cases}
d_{ij} = 1 & \\
d_{ij} = 0 & \text{for } i \neq B(1),...,B(m) \\
d_{B} = -B^{-1}A_j & \\
\end{cases}
$$</center>
