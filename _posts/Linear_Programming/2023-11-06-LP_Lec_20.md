# Preparation

Recall the **Relations between primal and dual variables and constraints**

Let's change the form in following way

# Weak Duality

**Theorem: ** Weak Duality. Given a primal/dual pair of LP problems, If $\bar{x}$ is a **feasible solution** of the primal problem (min problem) and $\bar{p}$ is a **feasible solution** of the dual problem (max problem), then $\bar{p}^\top \bar{b} \leq \bar{c}^\top \bar{x}$.

**Proof:** Given $\bar{x}$ primal feasible and $\bar{p}$ dual feasible, we have:

1. $\bar{a}_i^\top \bar{x} - b_i$, and $\bar{p}_i$ have the same sign
2. $\bar{x}_j$ and $(c_j - \bar{p}^\top \bar{A}_j)$ have the same sign

This leads to the inequalities:

- $\bar{p}_i (\bar{a}_i^\top \bar{x} - b_i) \geq 0$ for $i=1,\ldots,m$
- $(c_j - \bar{p}^\top \bar{A}_j)\bar{x}_j \geq 0$ for $j=1,\ldots,n$

Summing these up, we get:

$$
\bar{p}^\top (A\bar{x} - \bar{b}) = \sum_{i=1}^m \bar{p}_i (\bar{a}_i^\top \bar{x} - b_i) \geq 0
$$

and

$$
(\bar{c}^\top - \bar{p}^\top A)\bar{x} = \sum_{j=1}^n (c_j - \bar{p}^\top \bar{A}_j)\bar{x}_j \geq 0
$$

It follows that $\bar{c}^\top \bar{x} - \bar{p}^\top \bar{b} = (\bar{c}^\top - \bar{p}^\top A)\bar{x} + \bar{p}^\top (A\bar{x} - \bar{b}) \geq 0$. $\square$



**Corollary 1**

(a) If the optimal cost in the primal problem is $-\infty$, then the dual problem must be infeasible.

(b) If the optimal cost in the dual problem is $+\infty$, then the primal problem must be infeasible.

**Proof.** Denote the Polyhedra of Primal and dual problems is $P$ and $D$.

(a) Suppose that the optimal cost in the primal problem is $-\infty$ and that the dual problem has a **feasible solution** $\bar{p}$. By weak duality,

$$
\bar{p}^\top \bar{b} \leq \bar{c}^\top \bar{x} \quad \forall \bar{x} \in P.
$$

We know $\bar{p}^\top \bar{b}$ is a finite number. But ${ \bar{p}^\top \bar{b} \leq \min \\{\bar{c}^\top \bar{x} \mid \bar{x} \in P \\}}$, which 
contradicts to that optimal cost of the primal problem is $-\infty$. Therefore the dual problem cannot have a feasible solution if the optimal cost for the primal is $-\infty$.

(b) Suppose that the optimal cost in the dual problem is $+\infty$ and that the primal problem has a feasible solution $\bar{x}$. By weak duality,

$$
\bar{p}^\top \bar{b} \leq \bar{c}^\top \bar{x} \quad \forall \bar{p} \in D.
$$

We know $\bar{c}^\top \bar{x}$ is a finite number. But ${ \max \\{\bar{p}^\top \bar{b} \mid \bar{p}\in D\\} \leq \bar{c}^\top \bar{x}}$, which contradicts to the optimal cost in the dual problem is $+\infty$. Therefore the primal problem cannot have a feasible solution if the optimal cost for the dual is $+\infty$. $\square$

**Corollary 2** Given a primal/dual pair of LP problems
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{minimize} \quad & \bar{c}^\top \bar{x} \\
\text{subject to} \quad & \text{...}
\end{aligned}
$$
and
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{maximize} \quad & \bar{p}^\top \bar{b} \\
\text{subject to} \quad & \text{...}
\end{aligned}
$$

If $\bar{x}$ is a **feasible solution** of the primal problem, $\bar{p}$ is a **feasible solution** of the dual problem, and <font color=red>$\bar{p}^\top \bar{b} = \bar{c}^\top \bar{x}$ </font>, then $\bar{x}$ is an **optimal solution** of the primal problem and $\bar{p}$ is an **optimal solution** of the dual problem.

**Proof:**
Since $\bar{p}$ is a feasible solution of the dual problem, the weak duality theorem tell us that

$$
\bar{p}^\top \bar{b} \leq \bar{c}^\top \bar{y}, \forall \bar{y} \in P
$$

And $\bar{p}^\top \bar{b} = \bar{c}^\top \bar{x}$, we have

$$
\bar{c}^\top \bar{x} \leq \bar{c}^\top \bar{y}, \forall \bar{y} \in P
$$

By assumption, we know $\bar{x}$ is a feasible solution of primal problem. Hence $\bar{x}$ is an optimal solution of the primal problem.

On the other hand, since $\bar{x}$ is a feasible solution of the primal problem, the weak duality theorem asserts that

$$
\bar{q}^\top \bar{b} \leq \bar{c}^\top \bar{x}, \forall \bar{q} \in D
$$

Since $\bar{p}^\top \bar{b} = \bar{c}^\top \bar{x}$, it follows that $\bar{q}^\top \bar{b} \leq \bar{p}^\top \bar{b}, \forall  \bar{q} \in D. $ And $\bar{p}$ is feasible solution of dual problem. Hence, $\bar{p}$ is an optimal solution of the dual problem. $\square$



**Note:** The corollary 2 tells us if we can find  pair feasible solutions $\bar{x},\bar{p}$ in primal and dual problems, then we know they are both optimal solution in each problem, which give us an inspiration that the **optimal costs of primal and dual problem are equal**. The above idea lead to following theorem -- **Strong Duality**. In this proof, the key step is to construct a pair of feasible solutions such that <font color=red>$\bar{p}^\top \bar{b} = \bar{c}^\top \bar{x}$ </font>.

# Strong Duality

**Theorem:** Strong Duality. If a LP problem admits an optimal solution, so does its dual, and the respective (primal and dual) optimal costs are equal.

**Proof.**

First, we consider the **primal problem in standard form**, and then generalize this conclusion.

Consider the standard form primal problem:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{minimize} \quad & \bar{c}^\top \bar{x} \\
\text{subject to} \quad & A\bar{x} = \bar{b} \\
& \bar{x} \geq \bar{0}
\end{aligned}
$$

and its dual problem:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{maximize} \quad & \bar{p}^\top \bar{b} \\
\text{subject to} \quad & \bar{p}^\top A \leq \bar{c}^\top.
\end{aligned}
$$

Assume (temporarily) that the rows of $A$ are linearly independent and that there exists an optimal solution to the primal problem. The simplex algorithm applied to the primal problem will terminate with an optimal basis $B$. The vector of basic variables of the corresponding optimal (primal) basic feasible solution $\bar{x}$ is $B^{-1}\bar{b}$. At $\bar{x}$. where the simplex algorithm terminates, the reduced costs must be nonnegative:

$$
\bar{c}^\top - \bar{c}_B^\top B^{-1}\bar{A} \geq \bar{0}^\top
$$

Set $\bar{p} = \bar{c}_B^\top B^{-1}$. Then $ \bar{p}^\top A = \bar{c}_B^\top B^{-1} A \leq \bar{c}^\top$, which shows that $\bar{p}$ is a feasible solution of the dual problem. Furthermore, we have

$$
\bar{p}^\top \bar{b} = \bar{c}_B^\top B^{-1}\bar{b} = \bar{c}_B^\top \bar{x}_B= \bar{c}^\top \bar{x}
$$

Since the dual cost at the dual feasible solution $\bar{p}$ is equal to the primal cost at the primal optimal solution $\bar{x}$, **Corollary 2** asserts that $\bar{p}$ is an optimal solution to the dual problem. Hence the dual optimal cost $\bar{p}^\top \bar{b}$ is equal to the primal optimal cost $\bar{c}^\top \bar{x}$. 

Now let's consider the **general cases**, by [theorem](https://wu-haonan.github.io/2023/11/03/LP_Lec_19.html#dual-of-equivalent-problems-are-equivalent), we know dual problems of equivalent problems are equivalent. We can reformulate any LP problem $\Pi$ into standard form $\Phi$. So, we know optimal costs of problem $\Pi$ and $\Phi$ are equal. And we know optimal costs are equal in dual and primal problem in standard form case. Hence, we know the optima costs of $\Pi$ and its dual problem are equal. $\square$



# Relations between Primal and Dual

The table below illustrates the relationships between the primal and dual problems:

|      PRIMAL \ DUAL       | Optimal Cost is $+\infty$ | Finite Optimal Cost |    Infeasible    |
| Optimal Cost is $-\infty$ |   X   |            X             |        ✓        |
| Finite Optimal Cost |           X            |            ✓             |        X         |
|        Infeasible        |           ✓           |            X             | ✓($*$) |

- A checkmark (✓) denotes a possible scenario.
- A cross (X) indicates an impossible scenario.

For ($*$) case, we can give an example to verify the possibility

Primal Problem: 

$$
\begin{aligned} \text{minimize} \quad & x_1 + 2x_2 \\ 
\text{subject to} \quad & x_1 + x_2 = 1 \\ 
& 2x_1 + 2x_2 = 3 \end{aligned}
$$

Dual Problem: 

$$
\begin{aligned} \text{maximize} \quad & p_1 + 3p_2 \\ 
\text{subject to} \quad & p_1 + 2p_2 = 1 \\ & p_1 + 2p_2 = 2 \end{aligned}
$$



# Complementary Slackness

**Theorem**  Complementary Slackness. Given the **PRIMAL** problem (min problem) and the **DUAL** problem (max problem). And given a feasible solution $\bar{x}$ of the primal problem and a feasible solution $\bar{p}$ of the dual problem, we have:

 $\bar{x}$ is an optimal solution of the primal **and** $\bar{p}$ is an optimal solution of the dual **if and only if**

- $\bar{p}_i(\bar{a}_i^\top \bar{x} - b_i) = 0 \quad \forall i\in\\{1,\ldots,m\\}$ (slackness in primal constraint)
- $(c_j - \bar{p}^\top \bar{A}_j)\bar{x}_j = 0 \quad \forall j\in\\{1,\ldots,n\\}$ (slackness in dual constraint)

**Proof:**

As we shown earlier, $\bar{x}$ is a feasible solution of the primal **and** $\bar{p}$ is a feasible solution implies

$$
u_i := \bar{p}_i(\bar{a}_i^\top \bar{x} - b_i) \geq 0, \quad \forall i \quad (A)
$$

and

$$
v_i := (c_j - \bar{p}^\top \bar{A}_j)\bar{x}_j \geq 0, \quad \forall j \quad (B)
$$

These lead to

$$
\begin{aligned}
0 \leq \sum_{j=1}^n v_j + \sum_{i=1}^m u_i &= \sum_{i=1}^m \bar{p}_i (\bar{a}_i^\top \bar{x} - b_i) + \sum_{j=1}^n (c_j - \bar{p}^\top \bar{A}_j)\bar{x}_j \\
& =(\bar{c}^\top - \bar{p}^\top A)\bar{x} + \bar{p}^\top (A\bar{x} -\bar{b})\\
&= \bar{c}^\top \bar{x} - \bar{p}^\top \bar{b} \quad (*)
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, $\bar{x}$ primal optimal **and** $\bar{p}$ dual optimal implies, by **strong duality**, we have
$$
\bar{c}^\top \bar{x} - \bar{p}^\top \bar{b} = 0
$$

Form $(*)$ we know,
$$
\sum_{j=1}^n v_j + \sum_{i=1}^m u_i = 0
$$
Then, by (A) and (B), we get $u_j = 0, \forall j \in \{1,\ldots,n\}$ and $v_i = 0, \forall i \in \{1,\ldots,m\}$. All the deduction are sufficient and necessary, so we can prove the converse statement. Proof done. $\square$



**Note:** In fact, we can derive the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) condition of Linear Programming problem from Complementary Slackness. In other word, we can use this condition to check if a solution is a optimal solution of primal problem. 



## Primal in std form

Suppose $\bar{x}^*$ is a **nondegenerate optimal basic feasible solution** of

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{minimize}  \quad & \bar{c}^\top \bar{x} \\
\text{subject to}   \quad & \bar{A}\bar{x} = \bar{b}\\
& \bar{x} \geq \bar{0}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

and $x^\*_j$ is a basic component of the optimal b.f.s. $\bar{x}^\*$. Then the complementary slackness condition $(\bar{c}_j - \bar{p}^\top \bar{A}_j)\bar{x}^\*_j = 0$ must be satisfied by any optimal solution $\bar{p}^\*$ of the dual problem.

Since $\bar{x}^\*$ is a nondegenerate b.f.s and $x^\*_j$ is a basic component of it, it must be that $x^\*_j > 0$. Therefore, any optimal solution $\bar{p}^\*$ of the dual problem must satisfy $(\bar{p}^{\*})^\top \bar{A}_j = \bar{c}_j$ for every basic index $j$ (at the primal optimal b.f.s. $\bar{x}^\*$). Hence any optimal solution $\bar{p}^\*$ of the dual problem must be a solution of the linear system

$$
(\bar{p}^*)^ \top B = \bar{c}_B^\top
$$

which leads to

$$
\bar{p}^\* = \bar{c}_B^\top B^{-1}
$$

If the primal problem is in standard form and a **nondegenerate optimal basic feasible solution** is known, the complementary slackness conditions determine a **unique optimal solution** to the dual problem.



# Genomic View

Now, we can try to portray the relation between primal and dual from **geometric view**. I think this part can give us a intuition that how mathematicians figure out the "**Dual problem**".


$A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix (with $m \geq n$ since we must have $\text{rank}(A)= n$), $\bar{b} \in \mathbb{R}^m$ and $\bar{c} \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Consider the following pair of primal and dual problem

**PRIMAL**

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{minimize}  \quad & \bar{c}^\top \bar{x} \\
\text{subject to}   \quad & A\bar{x} \geq \bar{b}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

**DUAL**

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{minimize}  \quad & \bar{c}^\top \bar{x} \\
\text{subject to}   \quad & \bar{p} \geq \bar{0}\\
& \bar{p}^\top A = \bar{c}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Let $I$ be a subset of ${\\{1,2,\ldots,m\\}}$ such that ${\\{\bar{a}_i \mid i \in I\\}}$ is a basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$. Note that $I$ necessarily contains $n$ elements. Since ${\\{\bar{a}_i \mid i \in I\\}}$ is a basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$, the linear system $\bar{a}_i^\top \bar{x} = b_i , i \in I$ has unique solution $\bar{x}^I$. This vector $\bar{x}^I$ is a **basic solution of the primal problem**.

## NONDEGENERATE CASE

Suppose this basic solution $\bar{x}^I$ is nondegenerate, i.e., $\bar{a}_i^\top \bar{x}^I \neq b_i$ for $i \notin I$. In other words, $I$ is precisely the subset of $\{1, 2, \ldots, m\}$ indexing the primal constraints active at the nondegenerate basic solution $\bar{x}^I$ of the primal problem.

Let $\bar{p} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be an optimal solutions of the primal and the dual problem. According to Complementary Slackness, $\bar{x}^I$ and $\bar{p}$ must satisfy (1), (2), (3) below.

(1). **Primal feasibility**: $\bar{a}_i^\top \bar{x}^I \geq b_i$, ${\forall i \in \\{1, 2, \ldots, m\\}}$

(2). **Complementary slackness**: $p_i = 0$, $\forall i \notin I$. (Because ${p_i(\bar{a}_i^\top \bar{x} - b_i) = 0 , \forall i\in\\{1,\ldots,m\\}}$,  and $\forall i \notin I, \bar{a}_i^\top \bar{x}^I \neq b_i$, so $p_i$ has to be $0$.)

(3). **Dual feasibility**: $\sum_{i =1}^m p_i \bar{a}_i = \bar{c}$ and $\bar{p} \geq \bar{0}$.


Since $\\{\bar{a}\_i \mid i \in I\\}$ is a basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$, (2) and (3) can determine a unique solution, say $\bar{p}^I$. (In specific, $\forall i \notin I, p_i=0$ and $\sum\_{i \in I} p\_i \bar{a}\_i = \bar{c}^\top$). The vectors $\bar{a}_i$, with $i \in I$, form a **basis for the dual problem** (which is in standard form) and $\bar{p}^I$ is the associated basic solution. If $\bar{p}^I \geq \bar{0}$, this basic solution $\bar{p}^I$ is a b.f.s of the dual.


**Attention!** If $\bar{x}^I$ is a nondelegate basic feasible solution and we can compute unique solution $\bar{p}^I$, if $\bar{p}^I \geq \bar{0}$ (feasible solution of dual problem), we know we have $\bar{x}^I,\bar{p}^I$ are all feasible and meet complementary slackness, that means $\bar{x}^I$ and $\bar{p}^I$ are all optimal solution in primal and dual problem. 

**Note:** In another view, we need a set of nonnegative $p_i$ such that $\sum_{i\in I} p_i \bar{a}_i = \bar{c}$, that means $\bar{c}$ and any normal vector of active constraint $\bar{a}_i, i \in I$ must have a sharp angle. Or in geometric view, we observe $\bar{c}$ is caught around all the normal vector $\bar{a}_i, i \in I$.

### Example

Let's give an example from textbook[^1].

<p align="center">
    <img src="/post_image/Linear_Programming/geo_view_dual.PNG" width="70%">
<p>


Consider a primal problem with two variables and five inequality constraints ($n = 2, m = 5$), and suppose that no two of the vectors $\bar{a}_i$ are collinear. Every two-element subset $I$ of ${\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}}$ determines basic solutions $\bar{x}^I$ and $\bar{p}^I$ of the primal and the dual, respectively.

- If ${I = \\{1,2\\}}$, $\bar{x}^I$ is primal infeasible (point A) and $\bar{p}^I$ is dual infeasible, because $\bar{c}$ cannot be expressed as a nonnegative linear combination of the vectors $\bar{a}_1$ and $\bar{a}_2$.

- If ${I = \\{1,3\\}}$, $\bar{x}^I$ is primal feasible (point B) and $\bar{p}^I$ is dual infeasible.

- If ${I = \\{1,4\\}}$, $\bar{x}^I$ is primal feasible (point C) and $\bar{p}^I$ is dual feasible, because $\bar{c}$ can be expressed as a nonnegative linear combination of the vectors $\bar{a}_1$ and $\bar{a}_4$. Hence, $\bar{x}^I$ and $\bar{p}^I$ are optimal.

- If ${I = \\{1,5\\}}$, $\bar{x}^I$ is primal infeasible (point D) and $\bar{p}^I$ is dual feasible.



## DEGENERATE CASE

If $\bar{x}^\*$ is a degenerate basic solution to the primal problem, there can be several subsets $I$ of $\\{1,2,\ldots,m\\}$ such that $\bar{x}^\* = \bar{x}^I$.

For instance[^1], in the example below, we have $\bar{x}^\* = \bar{x}^J = \bar{x}^K$ for $J = \\{1,2\\}$ and $K = \\{2,3\\}$.

Solving $\sum_{i \in I} \bar{p}_i \bar{a}_i = \bar{c}$ using different choices for $I$, we may obtain several basic solutions $\bar{p}^I$ to the dual problem all satisfying the complementary slackness relations relative to $\bar{x}^*$.

<p align="center">
    <img src="/post_image/Linear_Programming/geo_view_dual_degen.PNG" width="70%">
<p>

It may well be the case that some of them are dual feasible and some are not.

For instance, in the example above, we have
- ${J = \\{1,2\\}$, $\bar{x}^J = \bar{x}^*}$ primal feasible, $\bar{p}^J$ dual infeasible;

- ${K = \\{2,3\\}$, $\bar{x}^K = \bar{x}^*}$ primal feasible, $\bar{p}^K$ dual feasible;

Since $\bar{x}^K$ is primal feasible, $\bar{p}^K$ is dual feasible, and they satisfy the complementary slackness relations, they are both optimal b.f.s.
