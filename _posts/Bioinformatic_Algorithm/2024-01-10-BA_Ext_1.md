A DNA string is a **reverse palindrome** if it is equal to its reverse complement. For instance, $\textbf{ATGCAT}$ is a reverse palindrome, because its reverse string $\textbf{TACGTA}$ can complementarily match to origin string. 

$$
\begin{align*}
& \text{ATGCAT}\\
& \mid \,\; \mid \,\; \mid \,\; \mid \,\; \mid \,\; \mid \,\\
& \text{TACGTA}
\end{align*}
$$

This phenomenon is quite common in our DNA or RNA sequences. We hope to find all occurrences of reverse palindrome in text $T$. In fact, there are at most $\Theta(n^2)$ palindrome substring in text with length $\vert T \vert = n$. In this blog, we will first give a na√Øve algorithm and use Manacher algorithm to solve this problem in $\mathcal{O}(n)$. In fact, we can do lowest common accessor on Suffix tree to implement this also, which will be introduced in [Extra topic 2](https://wu-haonan.github.io/2024/01/24/BA_Ext_2.html)
