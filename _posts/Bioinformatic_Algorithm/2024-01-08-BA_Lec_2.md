Last blog, we are talking about searching a pattern string in a text string. In fact, we treat the pattern string as a finite automaton which can jump to other position when we meet a mismatch. In this blog, we will consider a general case, that is find multiple pattern string in a text string. In specific, given a **dictionary** $D$ of $d$ words which has $m$ characters in total, we need to find all their occurrences in the text string $T$ with length $\vert T \vert = n$. If we employ KMP for each word in dictionary one-by-one, the total running time will be $\mathcal{O}(m+dn)$. In this blog, we will still use the idea similar as KMP, you will see the Trie and Aho-Algorithm in this blog.

# Trie

Instead of directly talking about how to improve the running time of multiple-words searching. We first consider that how to quickly check if a word in given dictionary $D$. For example, ${D = \\{\text{work},\text{worker}, \text{coworker}\\}}$. We denote the query word $q$ with size of $n$, and the total character of dictionary is $m$. If we compare word $q$ to each of the word in $D$, the running time is $\mathcal{O}(m)$. But, know, we can construct a new data structure for for dictionary, called **Trie**. Basically, Trie is a tree, each edge represent a character and each node represent the prefix that is all the character in the path from root note to this node.
