From today, I will post my study notes of Introduction to Computer Systems (following CMU 15213). In the meantime, I am going to finish the assignments in this book and post my solutions.

In most of our work, we just write down some text (code) in some litte box, and then the machine will outcomes some behavior that we intended our program to do. But we don't know why and how?

The purpose of this course is to give you enough  understanding of what that "<b>box</b>" is doing when it executes your code.

Let's see the first and simple program for most of the beginner in <b>C</b>, <font face="monaco">hello</font> program

{% highlight C linenos %}
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

We begin our study of systems by tracing the life time of the <font face="monaco">hello</font> program. The following sections will briefly introduce the main content of this course (textbook).

# Information = Bits + Context

This <font face="monaco">hello</font> program is saved in a text file called <font face="monaco">hello.c</font>, which begins its life as <i>source program</i> (or <i>source file</i>). In face the source file is a sequence of bits, which further organized in 8-bit chuncks called <i>bytes</i>. Each bytes represent some text character in the program. 

Most computer systems represent text character by ASCII standard. Like newline character '\\n' represented by interger value 10 (0000 1010 or 0A in hexadecimalism). The ASCII representation of <font face="monaco">hello.c</font> shown in following Fig

This example can illustrates a <b>fundamental idea</b> of computer systems: 

1. All information stored in memory is represented as a bunch of bits. 

2. The only thing that distinguishes different data objects is the context in which
we view them.

# Translate source file to machine

<font face="monaco">hello</font> program as a high-level C program can be read and understood by human beings, but not by machine. Therefore, the individual C statements must be translated by other programs into a sequence of low-level <i>machine-language</i> instructions. These instructions are then packaged in a form called <i>executable object program</i> and stored as a  binary disk file. Object programs are also referred to as <i>executable object files</i>.

On a Unix system, the translation from source file to object file is performed by a <i>compiler driver</i>:

{% highlight shell linenos %}
linux> gcc -o hello hello.c
{% endhighlight %}

By this command, the <b>GCC</b> compiler driver will read the source file <font face="monaco">hello.c</font> and translates it into an execuatable object file <font face="monaco">hello</font>. The translation contains four phases shown below. The programs that perform the four phases (<i><b>preprocessor</b></i>, <i><b>compiler</b></i>, <i><b>assembler</b></i>, and <i><b>linker</b></i> are known collectively as the <i>compilation system</i>.

1. <font color=red><b>Preprocessing phase</b></font>. The preprocessor (cpp) modifies the original C program according to Hash symbol '#'. Like '#include \<stdio.h\>', that tells the preprocessor copy all the contents of header file <font face='monaco'>stdio.h</font> and paste it in the source file <font face='monaco'>hello.c</font>. After preprocessing, we can get another C program, typically with '.i' suffix.
