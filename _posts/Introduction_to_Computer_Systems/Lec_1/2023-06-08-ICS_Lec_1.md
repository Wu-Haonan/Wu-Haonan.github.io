In most of our work, we just write down some text (code) in some litte box, and then the machine will outcomes some behavior that we intended our program to do. But we don't know why and how?

The purpose of this course is to give you enough  understanding of what that "<b>box</b>" is doing when it executes your code.

Let's see the first and simple program for most of the beginner in C, <font face="monaco">hello</font> program

{% highlight C linenos %}
# include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
    return 0;
}
