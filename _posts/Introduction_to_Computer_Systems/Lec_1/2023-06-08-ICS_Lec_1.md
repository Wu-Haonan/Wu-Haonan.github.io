In most of our work, we just write down some text (code) in some litte box, and then the machine will outcomes some behavior that we intended our program to do. But we don't know why and how?

The purpose of this course is to give you enough  understanding of what that "<b>box</b>" is doing when it executes your code.

Let's see the first and simple program for most of the beginner in <b>C</b>, <font face="monaco">hello</font> program

{% highlight C linenos %}
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

We begin our study of systems by tracing the life time of the <font face="monaco">hello</font> program. The following sections will briefly introduce the main content of this course (textbook).

# Information = Bits + Context

This <font face="monaco">hello</font> program is saved in a text file called <font face="monaco">hello.c</font>, which begins its life as <i>source program</i> (or <i>source file</i>). In face the source file is a sequence of bits, which further organized in 8-bit chuncks called <i>bytes</i>. Each bytes represent some text character in the program. 

Most computer systems represent text character by ASCII standard. Like newline character '\\n' represented by interger value 10 (0000 1010 or 0A in hexadecimalism). The ASCII representation of <font face="monaco">hello.c</font> shown in following Fig

This example can illustrates a <b>fundamental idea</b> of computer systems: 

1. All information stored in memory is represented as a bunch of bits. 

2. The only thing that distinguishes different data objects is the context in which
we view them.

# Translate source file to machine

<font face="monaco">hello</font> program as a high-level C program can be read and understood by human beings, but not by machine. Therefore, the individual C statements must be translated by other programs into a sequence of low-level <i>machine-language</i> instructions. These instructions are then packaged in a form called <i>executable object program</i> and stored as a  binary disk file. Object programs are also referred to as <i>executable object files</i>.

On a Unix system, the translation from source file to object file is performed by a <i>compiler driver</i>:

{% highlight shell linenos %}
linux> gcc -o hello hello.c
{% endhighlight %}

By this command, the <b>GCC</b> compiler driver will read the source file <font face="monaco">hello.c</font> and translates it into an execuatable object file <font face="monaco">hello</font>. The translation contains four phases shown below. The programs that perform the four phases (<i><b>preprocessor</b></i>, <i><b>compiler</b></i>, <i><b>assembler</b></i>, and <i><b>linker</b></i> are known collectively as the <i>compilation system</i>.

</p>

__Compilation system[^1].__

1. <font color=red><b>Preprocessing phase.</b></font> The preprocessor (cpp) modifies the original C program according to Hash symbol '#'. Like '#include \<stdio.h\>', that tells the preprocessor copy all the contents of header file <font face='monaco'>stdio.h</font> and paste it in the source file <font face='monaco'>hello.c</font>. After preprocessing, we can get another C program (in fact a text file), typically with '.i' suffix. 

2. <font color=red><b>Compilation phase.</b></font> The complier (cc1) tranlates the text file <font face='monaco'>hello.i</font> into the text file <font face='monaco'>hello.s</font>, which is an <i>assembly-language program</i>. Assembly language is useful because it provides a common output language for different compilers for different high-level languages.

3. <font color=red><b>Assembly phase.</b></font> Next, the assembler (as) translates <font face='monaco'>hello.s</font> into machine-language instructions, packages them as a <i>relocatable object program</i> and stored it in the object file <font face='monaco'>hello.o</font>, which is a binary file and hard to read for us.

4. <font color=red><b>Linking phase.</b></font> 
In our source file, we will call some function, the body of which are stored in other file. Like our <font face='monaco'>hello.c</font>, we call a funtion called <font face='monaco'>printf</font>, which actually is a part of <i>standard C library</i> provided by every C compiler. And the <font face='monaco'>printf</font> function resides in a separated precompiled object file called <font face='monaco'>printf.o</font>. To implement this function, we need to merge it into our <font face='monaco'>hello.o</font> binary file. The linker (ld) is in charge of this merging. Finally,  we get <font face='monaco'>hello</font> file, which is an <b><i>executable object file</i></b> (or simply <i>executable</i>) that is ready to be loaded into memory and executed by the system.

# Preprocessor and Execute Instructions

After four phases of translation, source file <font face='monaco'>hello.c</font> have been translated into an executable object file called
<font face='monaco'>hello</font>. To run it, we can type the following command

{% highlight shell linenos %}
linux> ./hello
hello, world
linux> 
{% endhighlight %}

In Unix system, <i>shell</i> is an application program, which is a command-line interpreter. We can type a command line, and shell will performs it. If the first word of the command line is not a built-in shell command, the shell will assume it as a name of an excuatable file, then load and run it. In this case, the shell loads and run <font face='monaco'>hello</font> program, and waits for it to terminate. <font face='monaco'>hello</font> program print a message 'hello, world' to the screen, then terminates. In the end, shell prints a prompt '\>', and waits for next command. 

## Hardware Organization of a System

In this section, we will introduce the hardware organization of a typical system, which's shown below. 

<p align="center">
    <img src="/post_image/Introduction_to_Computer_Systems/Hardware_Organization.PNG" width="80%">
</p>

__Hardware Organization. CPU: central processing unit, ALU: arithmetric/logic unit, PC: program counter, USB: Universal Serial Bus[^1]__

1. <font color=red><b>Buses.</b></font> 
A collection of electrical conduits called <i><b>buses</b></i> is running throughout the system. The function of Buses is carrying bytes of information back and forth between the components. Buses are typically designed to transfer fixed-size chunks of bytes known as <i><b>words</b></i>. The number of bytes in a word (the word size) is a fundamental system parameter that varies across systems. Most machines today have word sizes of either 4 bytes (32 bits) or 8 bytes (64 bits).

2. <font color=red><b>I/O Devices.</b></font>
Input/output (I/O) devices are the system's <b>connection</b> to the external world. Like our keyboard and mouse for user input, a display for user output, and a disk drive (or disk) for long-term storage of data and program. Initially, the executatble <font face='monaco'>hello</font> program resides in the disk.

    Each I/O devices is connected to the I/O bus by either a <i><b>controller</b></i> or an <i><b>adapter</b></i>. The difference between them two is the mainly of packaging.

    * <b>Controller</b> are chip in the <i>device itself</i> or on the system's <i>main printed circuit board</i> (often called <i><b>motherboard</b></i>).

    * <b>Adapter</b> is a card that plugs into a slot on the <i>motherboard</i>. 

    Anyaway, the function of each is to transfer information between an I/O device and the I/O bus.

3. <font color=red><b>Main Memory.</b></font>
The <i><b>main memory</b></i> is a <b>temporary storage device</b>. When the processor is executing the program, main memory holds both a program and the data it manipulates. Physically, main memory consists of a collection of <i><b>dynamic random access memory</b></i> (DRAM) chips. Logically, memory is organized as a linear array of bytes, each with its own <b>unique address</b> (<i><b>array index</b>)</i> starting at zero. Each machine instructions are stored in main memory. And the any kinds of variable (<font face='monaco'>int</font>, <font face='monaco'>float</font>, etc.) are stored in main memory. 

4. <font color=red><b>Processor.</b></font>
The <i><b>central processing unit</b></i> (CPU), or simply <i><b>processor</b></i>, is the engine that interprets (or <i><b>executes</b></i>) instructions stored in main memory. There's a word-size storage device (or <i><b>register</b></i>) called the <i><b>program counter</b></i> (PC) in CPU. At any point in time, the PC <b>points at</b> (contains the address of) some <b>machine-language instruction</b> in main memory.

    At any time the system is powered, the processor repeatedly executes the instruction pointed at by the PC, and updates PC to point to the next instruction. The next instruction, may or may not be contiguous in memory to the instruction that was just executed. 

    A processor appears to operate according to a very simple instruction execution
model, defined by its <i><b>instruction set architecture</b></i>. The processor reads the instruction from memory pointed at by the
program counter (PC), interprets the bits in the instruction, performs some <b>simple
operation</b> dictated by the instruction, and then updates the PC to point to the next
instruction. 

    There are only a few of these <b>simple operations</b>, and they revolve around
main memory, the <i><b>register file</b></i>, and the <i><b>arithmetic/logic unit</b></i> (ALU). 
    * The <b>register file</b> is a small storage device that consists of a collection of word-size registers, each with its own unique name.     

    * The ALU computes new data and address values. 
    
    Here are some examples of the <b>simple operations</b> that the CPU might carry out at the request of an instruction

    * <font color=red><i>Load</i>.</font>: Copy a byte or a word <b>from main memory into a register</b>, overwriting the previous contents of the register. 

    * <font color=red><i>Store</i>.</font>: Copy a byte or a word <b>from a register to a location in main memory</b>, overwriting the previous contents of that location.

    * <font color=red><i>Operate</i>.</font>: Copy the <b>contents of two registers</b> to the ALU, perform an <b>arithmetic operation</b> on the two words, and <b>store</b> the result in <b>a register</b>, overwriting the previous contents of that register. 

    * <font color=red><i>Jump</i>.</font>: Extract a word <b>from the instruction</b> itself and <b>copy</b> that word into the
<b>program counter</b> (PC), overwriting the previous value of the PC.
