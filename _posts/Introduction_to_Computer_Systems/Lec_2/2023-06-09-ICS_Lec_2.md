In this and next couple of blogs, we gonna talking about data representations, how numbers are represented in different forms and some of the properties. We need to understand what is the bit level representation of numbers and how does that affect some of the properties when we operate them on. Especially, we need to pay attention to these corner cases.

# Encoding Byte Values

We commonly group collections of <b>4 bits</b> at a time, and represent that in base 16 (hexadecimal representation, ${ 1,2,\cdots,9,A,B,\cdots, F  }$). Using the letters A throught F as values 10 through 15. And a <b>byte</b> is 8 bits.

# Boolean Algebra

* <b>And</b> A&B = 1, when both A = 1 and B = 1

* <b>Or</b> A|B = 1, when either A = 1 or B = 1
* <b>Not</b> ~A = 1, when A = 0
* <b>Exculsive-Or (Xor)</b> A^B = 1, when A,B are different

Here is a <b>Example</b>, we can use 8 bits to represent a set ${ A }$, the element is ${ 0,\cdots,7 }$. ${  a_j = 1 }$ if ${ j \in A}$. Let's give two sets ${ A_1=\{0，3，5，6\}, A_2=\{0,2,4,6\} }$, we represent it as 

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&01101001  &A_1 = \{0,3,5,6\}\\
&~~65~~3~~~~0 &\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

<center>$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&01010101  &A_2 = \{0,2,4,6\}\\
&~~6~~4~~2~~0 &\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$</center>

And, the Boolean operations can have some specific meaning

* & <b>Intersection</b> 01000001 {0,6}
* | <b>Union</b> 01111101 {0,2,3,4,5,6}
* ^ <b>Symmetric difference</b> (all the unique elements in each set) {2,3,4,5}
* ~ <b>Complement</b> 10101010 {1,3,5,7}

# Contrast: Logic Operations in C

Actually, &&, ||, ! (exclamation mark, or is pronounced as "bang") have different meaning with &, |, ~ in C. They are <b>logic operation</b> rather than bit operation. 

For &&, ||, !, they have following properties

* View 0 as "Flase"
* Anything nonzero as "True"
* Always return 0 or 1
* <font color=red>Early termination</font>

Here are some examples (char data type)

* !0x41 ${ \rightarrow }$ 0x00 (0x41 is a nonzero bit pattern, so it represents True. Thus, !0x41 = Flase = 0x00)
* !0x00 ${ \rightarrow }$ 0x01
* !!0x41 ${ \rightarrow }$ 0x01

* 0x69 && 0x55 ${ \rightarrow }$ 0x01 (True && True ${ \rightarrow }$ True = 0x01)
* 0x69 || 0x55 ${ \rightarrow }$ 0x01 (True || True ${ \rightarrow }$ True = 0x01)
