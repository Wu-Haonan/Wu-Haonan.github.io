In this series, I will introduce the Fundamental Contents in Computer Theory and Algorithms. If you hope to learn more advanced algorithms and techniques, please move to my another series [**Algorithm Design and Analysis**](https://wu-haonan.github.io/2023/08/21/ADA_Lec_1.html). 

In this blog, I try to do some preparation for following contents. I prefer to introduce the algorithms in a more rigorous and strictly way. In theoretical computer science and algorithms, we will encounter lot of statements, like the correctness and running time for some specific algorithm. The way to assert a statement is true is **Proof**, then the statement will become a theorem (or lemma, claim, corollary anyway). Hence, we start from Logic which is very beginning of our story (may not be romantic but must be interesting and attractive).

Another part of this blog is number theory, which is powerful and common tool in our journey. Off course, we hope we can master more math, which are always the enrich toolbox for computer scientists.

# Logic

First, we will give the definition of **Proposition**. 

**Definition:** A **proposition** is a declarative sentence (that is, a sentence that declares a fact) that is either true or false, but not both. So we have **true proposition** and **false proposition**. 

**Definition:** The **truth value** of true proportion is true denote as $T$, and the **truth value** of false proportion is false denote as $F$.

We can denote proposition variables (or statement variables) by letters $p,q,r,s, \cdots$. The following step we will do is to combine some propositions together, that is **compound propositions**. 



**Definition:** Let $p$ be a proposition. The negation of $p$, denoted by $\lnot p$ (also denoted by $\bar{p}$). The truth value of the negation of $p,\lnot p$, is the opposite of the truth value of $p$.
